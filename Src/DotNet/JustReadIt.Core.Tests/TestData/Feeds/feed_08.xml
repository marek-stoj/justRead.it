He’ll be speaking at our upcoming <a href="http://thenextweb.com/conference/latinamerica/?utm_source=TNWBlog&utm_medium=marcopost&utm_campaign=Latam2013">TNW Conference Latin America</a>, which takes place on 28 and 29 August in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the conference, we caught up with Gomes to find out about what it’s like to do business in Brazil, how foreign companies should approach the market, and what we can expect from his talk.</p>
<p><strong>TNW: Through Boo-box, you have access to vast audience is Brazil. What characterizes the Brazilian online advertising market compared to other markets such as the US? What works best there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Our online advertising market differs from US on one major point: portals. In Brazil, until some years ago, all the Internet content consumption was in big portals. They are like newspapers: you choose one that you like best, pay for it monthly and get all your information from them, from politics news to stock quotes and even email messages. This was how Generation X consumed media: from one preferred source, as they did with newspapers in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Since the rise of Generation Y (or millennials), we changed the online behavior: we consume content and services from multiple sources, like blogs, social networks and online searches. The advertiser must adapt to this new online media environment, where people get content from multiple sources and displaying your ads on three or four portals don’t work as it used to.</p>
<p>Here in Brazil the portals are still with a big share of the online advertising budget, and only on the last few years the traditional advertisers are looking for new ways to reach the target-audience, since they need to keep improving the ROI of their online advertising campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>TNW:  Beyond Brazil you expanded into Argentina in 2011. How has your expansion strategy developed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> In 2011 we merged with an artificial intelligence company from Buenos Aires, they are the innovation core of our group and work in experimental products to clients like Unilever mostly with data mining and social media analysis.</p>
<p><strong>TNW: Any plans to expand beyond Latin America? Can you compete on a global scale?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I prefer not to discuss future plans, sorry :/</p>
<p><strong>TNW: What advice would you give to tech companies moving into the the Brazilian market?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Don’t think it is easy, it isn’t. Business in Brazil is much less objective than in markets like US. In Brazil, the best product/offer not aways is the winner, lots of other points are also decisive, like the relationship with the decision makers and your reputation on the market. So, improve your networking, meet the decision makers and prepare to have long meetings.</p>
<p><strong>TNW: We live in uncertain economic times. Are you upbeat about Brazil’s tech sector?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I’m very optimistic about Brazil’s tech market. We do have lots of challenges like improving the country’s infrastructure, online content quality and business processes but for an entrepreneur, every problem is also an opportunity, right? Someone will solve our problems, I hope it will be a good entrepreneur doing that.</p>
<p>Boo-box is working on the online content quality problem and the guys at <a href="http://www.easytaxi.com.br/">Easytaxi</a> are working on the infrastructure and transportation problem. Every day there’s an entrepreneur trying to solve an important problem in Brazil and that generates value and wealth.</p>
<p><strong>TNW: You’re taking part in the The Next Web Conference Latin America 2013. Can you give us a brief hint about what you’ll be speaking about there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Most of the early-stage tech companies face a very common problem: growing the user base. I’ll share some key learnings from my 6 years experience on how to grow your user base with online advertising. I’ll present some cases of Brazilian companies that are attracting more users with advertising campaigns on niche websites and social networks.</p>

<p>With version 6.2.0, you’ll now see a ‘Select & Buy’ option in your tags section, click on that and you can choose which tracks you wish to buy from iTunes – if they’re available – and make a single payment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/buy-in-bulk-shazams-ios-app-now-lets-users-buy-multiple-tagged-songs-simultaneously/b-319/" rel="attachment wp-att-657929"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-657929" alt="b14 220x330 Buy in bulk: Shazam for iOS now lets you purchase multiple tagged songs simultaneously" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/b14-220x330.png" width="220" height="330" title="b14 220x330 photo" /></a>    <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/buy-in-bulk-shazams-ios-app-now-lets-users-buy-multiple-tagged-songs-simultaneously/c-235/" rel="attachment wp-att-657930"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-657930" alt="c14 220x330 Buy in bulk: Shazam for iOS now lets you purchase multiple tagged songs simultaneously" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/c14-220x330.png" width="220" height="330" title="c14 220x330 photo" /></a></p>
<p>For music fans, this obviously means less friction from tagging through to point-of-sale given that they can purchase multiple songs in one fell swoop. Indeed, if you tag ten songs in one evening and want to buy them all, well, this speeds things up considerably.</p>
<p>However, for Shazam it’s also a smart move given the commission made off song sales. It’s clearly in its interests to remove the number of clicks required to make multiple purchases.</p>
<p>Another new feature introduced with the latest version is recommendations, which surfaces similar tracks purchased by other Shazam users. So now when you click on a particular tag, you’ll see a new Recommendations tab featuring an ensemble of songs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/buy-in-bulk-shazams-ios-app-now-lets-users-buy-multiple-tagged-songs-simultaneously/d-192/" rel="attachment wp-att-657931"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-657931" alt="d12 220x330 Buy in bulk: Shazam for iOS now lets you purchase multiple tagged songs simultaneously" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/d12-220x330.png" width="220" height="330" title="d12 220x330 photo" /></a>    <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/buy-in-bulk-shazams-ios-app-now-lets-users-buy-multiple-tagged-songs-simultaneously/e-152/" rel="attachment wp-att-657932"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-657932" alt="e8 220x330 Buy in bulk: Shazam for iOS now lets you purchase multiple tagged songs simultaneously" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/e8-220x330.png" width="220" height="330" title="e8 220x330 photo" /></a></p>
<p>Other updates with the latest version include more ‘try before you buy’ music previews, ‘improved’ voiceover for the iPhone and making it easier to share across the social sphere.</p>
<p>Shazam rolled out a <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/05/23/shazam-turns-on-auto-tagging-for-ipad-users-and-also-lets-them-explore-popular-songs-around-the-world/" target="_blank">major new update to its iOS app back in May</a>, introducing a single universal app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, as well as a slew of other new features.</p>
<p>Today’s introduction builds on this, and shows that Shazam is keen to maximize its revenue streams and, of course, make it easier for users to buy the music they like.</p>
<p>The update is live in the App Store now.</p>

Meanwhile, Apple struggled this past quarter as it didn’t have any new iPads to sell.</p>
<p>“Apple iOS shipments were 14.6 million iPads in Q2 2013 which declined 14 percent annually,” Peter King, Director of Tablets at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement. “In the same quarter a year ago the first Retina display iPads were launched which could partly explain the decline as there were no new models in this quarter.  However, to compensate that, iPad Mini which was not available a year ago, now freely available was expected to take the figure higher than 14.6 million.”</p>
<p>As for Microsoft, Strategy Analytics speculates there may be an uptick in Windows RT shipments this quarter due to price cuts by the company’s partners and the <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/07/14/you-can-now-buy-a-microsoft-surface-rt-for-349/">$150 price slash for the Surface RT</a>. Nevertheless, the shortage of apps “continues to be a problem, with seemingly little incentive for developers to work on the platform.”</p>
<p>With Windows not a big threat (yet?) Android is certainly making the same progress in tablets as it did in smartphones, slowly but surely usurping iOS. On the flipside, one quarter is hardly enough to set a trend, especially in such a relatively new market.</p>
<p>In fact, NPD today <a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/130730_shipments_of_tablet_pcs_expected_to_more_than_double_those_of_notebook_pcs.asp">released</a> projections that suggest shipments of tablets could reach nearly 364 million worldwide in 2014, more than double the projected 177 million shipments of notebook PCs and ultrabooks. By 2017, NPD expects tablet PC shipments to reach 589 million, while notebook PCs and ultrabooks will remain relatively flat at 176 million.</p>
<p>Here are those expectations in graph form:</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/130730_worldwide_mobile_pc__shipment_forecast.png"><img src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/130730_worldwide_mobile_pc__shipment_forecast.png" alt="130730 worldwide mobile pc  shipment forecast Strategy Analytics: Android tablet shipments up to 67% in Q2 2013, iOS fell to 28.3%, and Windows secured 4.5%" width="580" height="333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-657945" title="130730 worldwide mobile pc  shipment forecast photo" /></a></p>
<p>This cannibalization isn’t surprising in the slightest. Tablet growth is fueled by increased adoption in emerging regions thanks to lower prices, longer battery life, and “more convenient usage models” according to NPD.</p>
<p>“The PC market is clearly shifting away from notebooks and toward tablets,” Richard Shim, senior analyst with NPD DisplaySearch, said in a statement. “Supply chain indications reveal that previously planned production of notebook PCs is being pulled back due to declining adoption and that brands are gradually increasing the number of tablet PC models in their product mixes. Panel and finished goods suppliers are also increasing production of displays and other components for tablets in order to keep up with the market changes.”</p>

<p>The non-profit organization sent undercover investigators into three factories owned by Apple supplier Pegatron in China to assess alleged labor rights violations.</p>
<p>Although the report focuses on workers’ pay, hours and working conditions, it also confirms the lower cost plastic materials being used in Pegatron’s Shanghai factory to create Apple’s upcoming budget smartphone.</p>
<p>“(The factory’s) assembled products include iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, and low-priced plastic iPhones,” the report states.</p>
<p>A diary entry written by one of the undercover investigators while working at the factory continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today’s work is to paste protective film on the iPhone’s plastic back cover to prevent it from being scratched on assembly lines. This iPhone model with a plastic cover will soon be released on the market by Apple.</p>
<p>The task is pretty easy, and I was able to work independently after a five-minute instruction from a veteran employee. It took around a minute to paste protective film on one rear cover. The new cell phone has not yet been put into mass production, so quantity is not as important. This makes our job more slow-paced than in departments that have begun mass production schedules.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Photographs allegedly <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/237554/leaked-apple-packaging-points-to-budget-iphone-being-called-iphone-5c-rumor/">detailing the new iPhone’s packaging</a> were uploaded to the Chinese forum <a href="http://bbs.weiphone.com/read-htm-tid-6723695.html">WeiPhone</a> over the weekend. The name iPhone 5C is printed on the side of the box, possibly leaking the name of the device.</p>
<p>The authenticity of the images are re-inforced by further rumors which suggest the new iPhone will be offered <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/budget-iphone-said-to-be-iphone-5-refresh-arriving-with-new-handset-september-18-1169301">in a range of different colors</a>, similar to the current generation iPod Touch. The ‘C’ moniker could certainly equate to color – cheap is another option, but doesn’t have quite the same ring to it – and would help to differentiate the device from its white and graphite counterpart.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324391104578230060513922882.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTTopStories">Wall Street Journal</a> first reported that Apple was working on a cheaper version of the iPhone back in January, suggesting that it would launch later this year. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-09/apple-said-to-develop-cheaper-iphone-model-for-late-2013.html">Bloomberg</a> quickly joined the fray to report that it would retail somewhere between $99 and $149 – although it wasn’t specified if that was a SIM-free device, or part of a two-year contract.</p>
<p>Apple’s first foray into producing mid-range and low-end smartphones is telling given the iPhone’s notably premium branding up until now. A cheaper iPhone could grow Apple’s userbase exponentially in developing and emerging markets, and also carve out the swelling market share being taken by Google’s Android platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/Apple-iPhone-Lite-will-be-a-modified-Apple-iPhone-5-new-phones-to-be-introduced-September-18th_id45768">September 18</a> is the date currently being banded about for the cheaper iPhone’s official reveal. Not long now, it would seem.</p>

And a lot has happened to the peer-to-peer bike-sharing marketplace in the 16 months since it first opened for business.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/spinlister-national-launch/" target="_blank">US-wide rollout</a> announced in September, Spinlister then <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/30/strike-spinlister-strike-liquid/" target="_blank">rebranded as Liquid</a> before being closed down completely and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/spinlister-back-from-the-dead/" target="_blank">then brought back from the dead in April</a> as Spinlister by one of its seed investors. Founders <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/willydennis">Will Dennis</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/jnoh">Jeffrey Noh</a>, it seems, moved on to enjoy other pursuits.</p>
<p>In its original guise, Spinlister was a Web-based service that let users hire bikes from other users. So, for example, you rock up in New York looking for cheap access to your own wheels for a couple of days, and Spinlister would sort you out.</p>
<p>Now, in the wake of the great resurrection, Spinlister has unveiled its first <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=462&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fspinlister%2Fid663508077%3Fmt%3D8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mobile app</a> and opened globally. We caught up with original seed-investor and incumbant CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mlorero" target="_blank">Marcelo Loureiro</a> to get the lowdown on where things are at, and where they <em>could </em>be going.</p>
<h3>Spinlister spins back into town</h3>
<p>Spinlister has bikes listed from its users in all major US cities, as well as in some smaller ones. “We have 1,500 bikes listed in the US and Canada, and listings are consistently growing,” explains Loureiro.</p>
<p>Loureiro also tells us that Spinlister is now very much open for business around the world, with bicycles  listed in many major cities, including London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Zurich, Bern, Madrid, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Moscow,Tokyo, Singapore , Sydney, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/airbnb-for-bikes-spinlister-goes-global-launches-a-new-iphone-app-and-plans-for-other-outdoor-pursuits/b-318/" rel="attachment wp-att-657789"><img class="aligncenter size-fullwidth_post wp-image-657789" alt="b8 730x365 Airbnb for bikes Spinlister goes global, launches a new iPhone app and plans for other outdoor pursuits" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/b8-730x365.jpg" width="730" height="365" title="b8 730x365 photo" /></a></p>
<p>You simply indicate your city of choice, your size, style of bike and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Prices range from anything between $10 to $25 a day, though this obviously can be more or less depending on the bike and the perceived ‘value’. And all prices seem to be in US dollars which isn’t ideal, but given this is still technically an early-stage startup looking to gain traction, localized currencies can come later.</p>
<h3>Trust</h3>
<p>You arrange to meet up with the owner, shake hands and exchange the goods. It is very much like an Airbnb for bike-rentals, insofar as a lot of it is based on trust. The more bikes you rent or borrow, the more reviews you receive and the more your trustworthiness grows in the eyes of other users.</p>
<p>While the service is indeed now open globally, there is one significant caveat for the time-being. In the US and Canada, an insurance-based set-up means that if a bike is damaged or stolen during a rental period and the renter is unable to reimburse the money, Spinlister covers the cost up to $5,000.</p>
<p>This isn’t yet available outside of North America, but Loureiro says this should hopefully be remedied soon. “This is the next step, and we should be insuring European bikes in the next couple of  months,” he says. “I just need to have a bit more scale and make sense of insurance in each country.”</p>
<p>The launch of a mobile app is, of course, crucial to such a service. Now, you can decide at the last minute that you’d like to borrow a bike for an hour, day or week through the native app, optimized for iPhone and iPod touch.</p>
<p>You can search by size, type, location, availability and cost, as well as listing your own bike should you be going out of town for a few days and wish to monetize it. An in-app messaging system also lets you ask and answer questions before proceeding with a rental.</p>
<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/airbnb-for-bikes-spinlister-goes-global-launches-a-new-iphone-app-and-plans-for-other-outdoor-pursuits/a-395/" rel="attachment wp-att-657811"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-657811" alt="a9 Airbnb for bikes Spinlister goes global, launches a new iPhone app and plans for other outdoor pursuits" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/a9.jpg" width="453" height="372" title="a9 photo" /></a></p>
<p>There’s no question that Spinlister could and should prove to be a popular service around the world, tapping in to the growing trend of similar peer-to-peer services that cover everything from temporary accommodation (e.g. Airbnb) to getting your house painted (e.g. TaskRabbit).</p>
<p>But if Spinlister has already built a platform to facilitate short-term bike-hires, why couldn’t it be used for just about any other kind of product? Well, that’s exactly the road Loureiro tells us he’s looking to go down.</p>
<p>“Our next big step will be to open the service for winter sports listings – we are working now on catering for snowboards and skis,” he says, adding that this could be ready as early as October/November time this year. This will then be extended into surfboards, skateboards, shortboards, longboards and even longboards.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to be the global hub for peer-to-peer outdoor sports gear rentals,” he says.</p>
<p>Spinlister is open for business globally now, and the iPhone app quietly rolled out a couple of weeks ago. An Android incarnation should follow suit by the end of August 2013.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="520" height="245" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Autographer-520x245.jpg" alt="Autographer 520x245 Autographer review: We put this $615 wearable life logging camera to the test" title="Autographer 520x245 photo"  /><br /><p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.omgplc.com/companies/life">OMG Life’s</a> new life-logging <a href="http://www.autographer.com/#home">Autographer</a> camera promises to make capturing those candid moments a virtually effortless task by snapping away continuously as you go about your life. With wearable technology like <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/06/21/a-day-at-disneyland-with-google-glass/">Google Glass</a> coming to the fore, its timing could be just about right.</p>
<p>To address it by its correct term, life-logging is a fairly new phenomenon, at least in any practical way. It usually involves <a href="http://thenextweb.com/video/2013/06/13/a-photo-every-30-seconds-does-memotos-ceo-think-his-lifelogging-camera-has-a-privacy-problem/">some sort of wearable technology that tracks and captures your daily life</a> – in this case, in picture form. The company behind Autographer — OMG Life — actually set out wanting to create a black box device (as found in planes) for people, which gives you a good idea where it is coming from.</p>
<p>We’ve all wished we’d managed to get the camera out of our pocket, or phone unlocked, just a few seconds quicker in the past to capture that fleeting moment. Well, with Autographer, in theory you wouldn’t ever need to think that again.</p>
<p>In essence, the £400 ($615) device works by clipping onto a belt, bag strap, shirt or anywhere else you can get it to stay (there’s also a lanyard provided in the box). You then switch it on, selecting low, medium or high intervals of picture snapping (with high obviously resulting in far more photos than low).</p>
<p>While it’s only available in the UK and some European countries for now a wider release is expected to follow.</p>
<h3>Off to the zoo, back later</h3>
<p>To celebrate the launch and show off the capabilities of the camera, Autogapher took The Next Web along to London Zoo for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The unit itself is about the length of a packet of cigarettes and about half as wide, so certainly pocketable enough and has kept the on-device controls to a minimum: there are just two buttons (one to scroll through options and one to select) and a very simple display.</p>
<p>All you need to do to get up and running is switch the device on and open the lens cover. TNW was told that on-board storage will run to about 28,000 photos (8GB of storage) and battery life is about 10 hours on medium capture rate, meaning that you’ll run out of battery long before you run out of space.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Autographer_unit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-fullwidth_post wp-image-657753" alt="Autographer unit 730x380 Autographer review: We put this $615 wearable life logging camera to the test" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Autographer_unit-730x380.jpg" width="730" height="380" title="Autographer unit 730x380 photo" /></a></p>
<p>There are also controls for connecting to an iOS device to use the Autographer app (more on that later) and an option to manually tell the Autographer to take a series of photos. That large lump on the front of the device just above the camera lens is actually a movement sensor, rather than any kind of button. In addition to a PIR motion detector, the Autographer unit also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colour sensor: Autographer’s ‘eye’, perceiving light and brightness and adjusting the image accordingly</li>
<li>Temperature: in built thermometer, measuring ambient temperature</li>
<li>Magnetometer: determines which direction the camera is facing</li>
<li>Accelerometer: measures how quickly or slowly the Autographer is accelerating</li>
</ul>
<p>It then combines all this information with its algorithm to decide when to take a picture.</p>
<h3>Mind your fingers</h3>
<p>Clipping the camera on — I popped it, as recommended, on the neck of my t-shirt — we were led to the giant tortoise enclosure (before you ask, they don’t know how old but think he’s about 70). After being advised not to let our fingers get too close to his mouth while feeding him, we were let loose.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/b00000385_21i43l_20130725_094621e.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-fullwidth_post wp-image-657736" alt="b00000385 21i43l 20130725 094621e 730x545 Autographer review: We put this $615 wearable life logging camera to the test" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/b00000385_21i43l_20130725_094621e-730x545.jpg" width="730" height="545" title="b00000385 21i43l 20130725 094621e 730x545 photo" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking that’s a bit of a blurry picture, and you’d be right. The Autographer has a 5-megapixel camera with a 136-degree field of view which gives every picture a slight fish-eye effect.</p>
<p>The Autographer is also slightly different to a normal camera in that, while most cameras are optimized for taking their best pics when stationary, this little unit has to be able to keep churning them out while in continuous motion. Bearing this in mind, the shots aren’t <em>too </em>bad, but I wouldn’t be too upset if the picture above didn’t exist.</p>
<p>That’s not to say you can’t take a crisp shot with the Autographer, just that if you do it’ll be down to luck rather than anything you did. For example, a snap taken a few seconds before (below) is much crisper, but then my knee and arms are in the way. Again, I wouldn’t be too gutted to not have captured a close up of my hairy arm. We hadn’t even made it to the gorilla enclosure yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/b00000383_21i43l_20130725_094603e.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-fullwidth_post wp-image-657746" alt="b00000383 21i43l 20130725 094603e 730x545 Autographer review: We put this $615 wearable life logging camera to the test" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/b00000383_21i43l_20130725_094603e-730x545.jpg" width="730" height="545" title="b00000383 21i43l 20130725 094603e 730x545 photo" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a situation I saw repeated hundreds of times over during my time with the Autographer. Either the shots were borderline terrible quality, or were passably fine but otherwise ruined by someone or something blocking the picture. With few options on the unit, there’s not really a lot to mess about with and there’s no screen, so there’s no way of finding out whether you’re capturing gold or trash either.</p>
<p>There is an iOS app that accompanies the device which connects to your phone via Bluetooth, but I couldn’t find a way to continue shooting while it was connected to a phone. So, while you <em>can </em>stop taking pictures to connect it up and have a quick glance at the images, if you do so you run the risk of missing that shot that you really turned it on for. Check out the promotional video below for an overview of the app.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tNksUwnB-GA" height="411" width="730" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>During the morning, set on high capture, the camera took several hundred pictures – of which I’d think I’d probably like to keep about 5 – 10, which isn’t the best hit rate.</p>
<h3>Desktop software</h3>
<p>Reviewing the hundreds of pictures also isn’t as easy as it should be when you do finally get the unit back to a computer and plugged in to transfer the images. The actual import process is incredibly easy, just plug it in and hit import – it won’t double up on previously imported pictures, giving you the option to leave the snaps on the device post-import or to clear it ready for its next outing – but what you are met with is row after row of untagged images. Obviously tagging is the intended option, but with several hundred virtually worthless pictures I didn’t see the point.</p>
<p>Reviewing the ones you want to see in a slideshow (which can also be compiled into a ‘Movie’ in up to 1080p with a music track) is also possible, but to do so you’ll need to manually select each and every picture you want included in it – there’s no batch select option or support.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Autographer_stream.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-fullwidth_post wp-image-657768" alt="Autographer stream 730x381 Autographer review: We put this $615 wearable life logging camera to the test" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Autographer_stream-730x381.jpg" width="730" height="381" title="Autographer stream 730x381 photo" /></a></p>
<p>However, the software does have a feature I really like, which thanks to its GPS sensor, tracks and maps where every picture was taken. This is incredibly useful, particularly given the slightly lacking sorting options, as it’s far easier to remember where a picture was taken or what you were doing than exactly when it was taken. It’s particularly useful in a place like London Zoo which Google Maps already has covered in incredible detail.</p>
<p>Each of those dots represents a picture that was taken, zooming in shows even more of them and allows you to click on individual markers to jump to that photo.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Autographer_software_ZOO_map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-fullwidth_post wp-image-657770" alt="Autographer software ZOO map 730x401 Autographer review: We put this $615 wearable life logging camera to the test" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Autographer_software_ZOO_map-730x401.jpg" width="730" height="401" title="Autographer software ZOO map 730x401 photo" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was so disillusioned as to the overall quality of the images that came out of the Autographer that when I traveled the length of the country from London to Northumberland for a family birthday it seemed like the ideal opportunity to test it out again. However, we may well have been blessed with beautiful weather but we weren’t blessed with beautiful images. And once again, of the 800 or so images that were taken over the course of a few hours here and there, only 10 -20 are keepers.</p>
<p>While Autographer’s execution isn’t perfect at this stage, it is at least possible for OMG Life to update its firmware and add new options to the desktop client and app. However, for me, I’m not convinced that Autographer is a useful addition to my life as it is: the pictures are almost uniformly poor and on the occasions something dramatic did happen (at one point in the zoo a giant gorilla ran past the glass at full speed, banging on it as he went) there was no record of it. Ultimately, at the times where I thought, I really hope it got a snap of that, it hadn’t.</p>
<p>For the record, the gorilla came back and stared unhappily back at us, the Autographer <em>did </em>capture that.</p>

<h3>Would I buy one?</h3>
<p>The Autographer goes on sale tomorrow from <a href="http://www.autographer.com/#home">Autographer.com</a> and is priced at <em>just</em> under £400. If you’re keen to get one, they’re going on sale to customers in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Portugal, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden. A wider global release “will follow soon after”, OMG Life said.</p>
<p>While the Autographer is great at producing a timeline of snaps, it’s not good at producing a timeline of worthy ones. One thing that worked exactly as intended, however, was that I totally forgot about it once it was switched on. On the downside, it also meant that I ended up with 300 or so (not included in my previous picture totals from each day) completely black images where I had closed the lens cover for some reason (going to the bathroom, for example) but forgotten to open it up again.</p>
<p>As a device for tracking where you’ve been and what you saw (generally) the Autographer performs well, but as a device capable of capturing those candid one-off moments it does considerably less well. I’m mostly on board with the general idea (although the nefarious uses for a camera that just silently snaps away as you walk around are obvious) and it can be of particular use if you often find yourself struggling to find that one snap in your collection, but you know exactly where it was taken, but the execution on the Autographer just isn’t there yet. I’m also not a fan of having all of my pictures fish-eyed in style.</p>
<p>Perhaps future updates will improve the algorithm used to take the pictures and the performance of taking pictures while in motion but as it stands today, I’d be pretty disappointed if I’d just shelled out £400 for an Autographer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="520" height="245" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Citysfeat-520x245.jpg" alt="Citysfeat 520x245 Citysocializers iOS app now plots social gatherings on a map to let you see local activities at a glance" title="Citysfeat 520x245 photo"  /><br /><p><a href="https://www.citysocializer.com/" target="_blank">Citysocializer</a>, the mobile and Web-based service that helps you tap into social scenes wherever you wander, has launched an update to its <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=462&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fgb%2Fapp%2Fcitysocializer%2Fid581315807%3Fmt%3D8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iPhone app</a> today that introduces a new GPS map view of all ‘socials’ taking place in each location.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007 as Citysocialising by former BBC producer <a href="https://twitter.com/ubersaha" target="_blank">Sanchita Saha</a>, the app <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/06/03/citysocialising-goes-mobile-and-becomes-citysocializer-helping-you-tap-social-scenes-whereever-you-roam/" target="_blank">rebranded as Citysocializer back in June</a> just as it rolled out its first native mobile application. Though it’s currently very UK-centric, Citysocializer is looking to push out into the social sphere with a subscription-based approach to finding new friends anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>In terms of how it works, you tag your profile with what you like and the neighbourhoods and cities you frequent. You can also receive invites when like-minded people are getting together, or browse what are known as ‘Socials’ (basically get-togethers) that are happening around you.</p>
<p>Now, however, when perusing events you can swipe the page up to unveil socials happening in your locale too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/citysocializer/a-394/" rel="attachment wp-att-657700"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-657700" alt="a15 220x330 Citysocializers iOS app now plots social gatherings on a map to let you see local activities at a glance" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/a15-220x330.png" width="220" height="330" title="a15 220x330 photo" /></a>    <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/29/citysocializer/b-317/" rel="attachment wp-att-657701"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-657701" alt="b13 220x330 Citysocializers iOS app now plots social gatherings on a map to let you see local activities at a glance" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/b13-220x330.png" width="220" height="330" title="b13 220x330 photo" /></a></p>
<p>Throwing location-awareness into the mix is an obvious move for what, essentially, is a location-based social networking app.</p>
<p>“Research amongst our most active users show that the ‘what’ of an activity or night out comes top of the list when making a decision on whether to go out or not, and this is followed very closely by the ‘where’,” explains Sanchita Saha CEO and founder.</p>
<p>“Our members are predominantly busy young professionals who often make last minute decisions on going out,” she continues. “Therefore, proximity becomes key to making that decision as in London in particular, it can take an hour to get from one end of the city to the other and no-one wants to travel that far if they just fancy a drink after work for example.”</p>
<p>In terms of global availability, anyone from anywhere in the world can sign up and, once it hits 200 people from a particular region, this will unlock the full service and features for that area.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it’s ‘open’ across thirty UK cities, from London through to York, and in the coming weeks New York will become the first international city to be opened to Citysocializer.</p>
<p>For now, if you try to search for activity in any city outside the UK, you’ll be asked to invite friends from that place.</p>
<p>The Citysocializer app is free to download now, letting you browse existing socials, look at user profiles and ‘wave’ at others. To join in Socials and fully interact, this requires a fee of £3.99 ($6)/week via an in-app purchase and monthly, 3-month and 6-month memberships available via the website.</p>

<p>The Kantar Worldpanel ComTech report — compiled from 240,000 interviews per year in the US — puts Android on top for the third consecutive quarter. Android returns is back above 50 percent of sales after dropping to 49.3 percent <a href="http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/News/news-articles/Windows-sees-steady-growth-in-Q1-2013">in the previous report</a>.</p>
<p>The Google-owned platform is estimated to hold a dominant 51.5 percent share of sales in the US, ahead of iOS on 42.5 percent. Windows Phone is the nearest challenger way back on 4 percent, ahead of BlackBerry on 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>In a boost for Microsoft and Nokia, Windows Phone was saw the largest increase in the US over the past 12 months, as sales vastly improved on the 2.9 percent Kantar estimated one year previously. The bulk of that is likely from Nokia’s Lumia series, but the Finnish firm still has much work to do in the US, as its <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2013/07/18/nokia-reports-improved-151m-loss-in-q2-2013-after-selling-a-record-7-4m-lumia-smartphones/">Q2 2013 financial results</a> showed and Windows Phone is down from 5.6 percent in the previous report (although ‘season’ factors also saw Apple’s share of sales drop sequentially.)</p>
<p>iOS improved its share of sales from 39.2 percent last year but Android declined slightly from 52.6 percent. BlackBerry’s crash continued as it slumped down from a then-third ranked to account for a meager 1.1 percent of US smartphone sales as of June 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/us-smartphone-share-kantar.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-657682" alt="us smartphone share kantar Android top US smartphone platform with 52% of sales, Windows Phone charts highest growth: Kantar" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/us-smartphone-share-kantar.jpg" width="649" height="266" title="us smartphone share kantar photo" /></a>Operator-wise, Kantar judged Verizon to have performed best during the period.</p>
<p>Verizon notched a 5 percent gain in sales over the past year, standing out as the only operator to grow its numbers. Sprint takes the wooden spoon for biggest loss, with Kantar estimating that its unit sales figure declined by 8.5 percent to reach 13.8 million units, as of June 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/us-operator-sahre-kantar.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-657683" alt="us operator sahre kantar Android top US smartphone platform with 52% of sales, Windows Phone charts highest growth: Kantar" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/us-operator-sahre-kantar.jpg" width="613" height="271" title="us operator sahre kantar photo" /></a></p>
<p>Kantar estimates that 40 percent of all iOS devices sold went through Verizon — fractionally ahead of the 39 percent attributed to AT&T — and it is estimated to have captured more Android- and Windows Phone-based sales too.</p>
<p>That’s a fact that the research firm puts down to increased sales among the carrier’s female customers and feature phones owners who upgraded to smartphones.</p>
<p>“Verizon continues to lead in this second quarter of 2013, driven by its ability to provide a range of highly demanded brands and models, which has ultimately led to the carrier capturing the most sales from all three top OS brands,” said Dominic Sunnebo, global consumer insight director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/News/Apple-rebounds-as-iPhone-4-pulls-in-smartphone-first-timers-">Further research from the firm</a> showed that Apple performed well over the last three months in the UK, where the discounted iPhone 4 proved to be a popular choice for consumers buying a smartphone for the first time.</p>
<p>Kantar found that more than one third of iPhone 4 units were bought by first-time smartphone owners, that’s comparatively more than the iPhone 5, for which one in ten customers were smartphone first-timers.</p>
<p>That finding jives with comments Apple CEO Tim Cook made on the firm’s Q2 2013 earnings call, in which he said that the iPhone 4 was performing well, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/07/24/iphone-sales-surge-400-yoy-in-india-with-ipad-sales-on-the-rise-too-says-apple-ceo-tim-cook/">particularly in emerging markets like India</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="520" height="245" src="http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/07/Mobilicity-520x245.jpg" alt="Mobilicity 520x245 Toronto resident launches $389m crowdfunding campaign to buy out Canadian carrier Mobilicity" title="Mobilicity 520x245 photo"  /><br /><p>Crowdfunding is no longer just for startups — a Toronto resident has just set up a <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-us-save-mobilicity">project</a> on Indiegogo (hat-tip <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatTheBit">@WhatTheBit</a>) to “save” Canadian wireless telecommunications provider <a href="http://mobilicity.ca/">Mobilicity</a>, seeking to raise a jaw-dropping amount of C$400 million ($389 million).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/3260651">Valya Michael</a>, who created the project, says that after his team will purchase Mobilicity after it reaches the targeted fundraising amount. Out of the money, C$350 million will go to purchasing the company as a whole, C$20 million will be channeled into paying off the company’s debt, and C$30 million will go to adding cell towers and a call center.</p>
<p>The basis for this project? Michael says it is “extremely important” to have competition in the wireless market to lower prices, add more jobs and benefit consumers by upping service standards from wireless carriers. For a donation less than C$20, you get a tweet to thank you, while a contribution of C$50 will get your name listed on Michael’s website and C$100 will get you listed on the website as a sponsor.</p>
<p>If the amount raised does not hit C$400 million, Michael says that he will refund the money given by donors.</p>
<p>It’s not clear, however, whether Mobilicity has any part to play in this and if it would want to be “saved” in such a manner. The carrier, one of Canada’s newest that was launched in 2010, has been struggling amid financial challenges. It was the willing target of a proposed $380 million acquisition by <a href="http://telus.com/">Telus</a>, one of Canada’s larger telecommunications company, but <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/telus-abandons-mobilicity-deal/article12464225/">the deal got shot down</a> by Canadian Industry Minister Christian Paradis in light of federal laws that prevent large carriers from getting more wireless spectrum till 2014.</p>
<p>Subsequently, it was reported that <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/07/10/business-mobilicity-wireless.html">Mobilicity was in takeover talks</a> with multiple parties to try to find a buyer, with unconfirmed reports saying that Mobilicity was holding talks with US wireless giant Verizon.</p>
<p>It’s rare for a customer to love his wireless service provider so much (most tend to think they are out to rip money off consumers), but it remains to be seen if Mobilicity — which has about 250,000 cellphone subscribers — will inspire so many to give out of their pocket.</p>
<p>As of now, the amount raised stands at a paltry C$213 — though there are 30 more days to go, the likelihood of this project raising the entire C$400 million is honestly, next to zero.</p>
