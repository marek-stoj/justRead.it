			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/url-22.jpeg" alt="" title="url-2" width="320" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1374861" />Rumors flew Monday morning that Bill and <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=hillary+clinton" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> were unhappy with <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=anthony+weiner" target="_blank">Anthony Weiner&#8217;</a></strong>s comparisons of his situation—a marriage spotlighted by sexual transgressions and public office—with the former presidential couple&#8217;s trials in the mid 1990s, and that while the Clintons supported longtime Hillary aide <strong>Huma Abedin</strong>, that sympathy did not necessarily extend to her sexting husband.</p>
<p>An anonymous Democratic official <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/clintons_mad_as_hill_over_huma_tactic_DreEqQum5fMMD4SiXeWSLJ?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&#038;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost" target="_blank">told the <em>New York Post</a></em>, “The Clintons are upset with the comparisons that the Weiners seem to be encouraging—that Huma is ‘standing by her man’ the way Hillary did with Bill, which is not what she in fact did&#8230;The Clintons are pissed off that Weiner’s campaign is saying that Huma is just like Hillary. How dare they compare Huma with Hillary? Hillary was the first lady. Hillary was a senator. She was secretary of state.”</p>
<p>“Hillary didn’t know Huma would do this whole stand-by-your-man routine, and that’s one of the reasons the Clintons are distancing themselves from all this nonsense,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>The <em>Post</em> also said that a top Clinton supporter was &#8220;close to going public&#8221; with criticism of Weiner, to signal that he should refrain from referencing the couple.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/clintons-stand-huma-weiner-article-1.1410414" target="_blank"><em>New York Daily News</em> reports</a> that since the multiple sexting scandals the Clintons have no particular loyalty to Weiner, who is &#8220;like that jerky son-in-law who married in,&#8221; according to one democratic official. Another Clinton friend said the former presidential couple &#8220;care about Huma and what’s best for Huma,&#8221; with the possible implicit message that Weiner may fall into the &#8220;not best for her&#8221; category.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/allen.jpg"><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/allen.jpg" alt="" title="allen" width="320" height="210" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1374871" /></a>WAAY-TV reporter <strong>Shea Allen</strong> posted a controversial &#8220;confessions&#8221; blog last week, caught some heat for it, and ultimately decided to leave it up in honor of the right to free expression.</p>
<p>The investigative reporter for Huntsville, Alabama&#8217;s ABC affiliate wrote a blog post last week, originally entitled &#8220;<a href="http://sheaallensays.blogspot.com/2013/07/no-apologies-confessions-of-red-headed.html" target="_blank">Confessions of a Red Headed Reporter</a>,&#8221; containing 10 confessional bullet-points on her looks, her TV career, and her beliefs. </p>
<p>Full list below:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. I&#8217;ve gone bra-less during a live broadcast and no one was the wiser. </p>
<p>2. My best sources are the ones who secretly have a crush on me. </p>
<p>3. I am better live when I have no script and no idea what I&#8217;m talking about. </p>
<p>4. I&#8217;ve mastered the ability to contort my body into a position that makes me appear much skinner [<em>sic</em>] in front of the camera than I actually am. </p>
<p>5. I hate the right side of my face. </p>
<p>6. I&#8217;m frightened of old people and I refuse to do stories involving them or the places they reside. </p>
<p>7. Happy, fluffy, rainbow stories about good things make me depressed. </p>
<p>8. I&#8217;ve taken naps in the news car. </p>
<p>9. If you ramble and I deem you unnecessary for my story, I&#8217;ll stop recording but let you think otherwise. </p>
<p>10. I&#8217;ve stolen mail and then put it back. (maybe) </p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the above admissions may have initially struck her fan-base/employer as too revealing, and so she reportedly pulled the post for a short time. </p>
<p>But after some thought, Allen later wrote, she decided to keep the post up, <a href="http://sheaallensays.blogspot.com/2013/07/no-apologies-confessions-of-red-headed.html" target="_blank">re-titling it</a>: &#8220;No Apologies: Confessions of a red headed reporter.&#8221; All 10 points remain, but she added a preface:</p>
<blockquote><p>This post was taken down because I was momentarily misguided about who I am and what I stand for. To clarify, I make no apologies for the following re-post. It&#8217;s funny, satirical and will likely offend some of the more conservative folks. But it isn&#8217;t fake and its a genuine look into my slightly twisted psyche. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;ve vowed to always fight for the right of free expression. It&#8217;s allowed, no matter what the profession. I pride myself in having earned the respect of many because I make no apologies for the truth and hold nothing back. I don&#8217;t fight for things because they serve me, I fight for them because they are right. Sources trust me because I am an unadulterated version of the truth. I won&#8217;t ever bend just because its popular to do so and I&#8217;m not bending now.</p></blockquote>
<p>As anyone who has worked in the broadcast news business will tell you, many of Allen&#8217;s confessions are actually quite common: </p>
<p>Number 2 reflects the unavoidable issue of getting better information from those who want something from you; Numbers 4 and 5 demonstrate the intense pressures female broadcasters feel in maintaining a youthful look; Number 7 makes sense, given the general consensus that happy stories rarely rate as well as dark ones; and Number 9 is <em>absolutely true</em>, and more man-on-the-street subjects should read this before rambling endlessly into the camera next time.</p>
<p>As for numbers 1 and 10? Eh, not so sure.</p>
<p>But kudos to Shea Allen for saying what was on her mind. Candor is a lacking trait among many aspiring TV journalists.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Allen updates me, <a href="https://twitter.com/SheaMallen27/status/361864433410125824 " target="_blank">via Twitter</a>, that she was &#8220;terminated without cause&#8221; for her confessional post. Unsure why exactly her post warranted unemployment, but we will wait to see if WAAY-TV has any comment.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/barry.jpg" alt="" title="barry" width="320" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1374641" />Former Washington, D.C. Mayor <strong>Marion Barry</strong> got into a profanity-laden fight with <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=geraldo+rivera" target="_blank">Geraldo Rivera</a></strong> on Saturday night, telling the host to &#8220;stop the bullsh*t&#8221; about his conviction for crack cocaine, before ultimately showing empathy for embattled New York City mayoral candidate <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=anthony+weiner" target="_blank">Anthony Weiner</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;One bit of advice to the congressman,&#8221; Marian Barry said. &#8220;I&#8217;d stop talking so much about now and start talking about what you did for seven terms while he was in the Congress. He&#8217;s a good Democrat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barry offered his sympathy to Weiner as someone &#8220;who has been through the mill,&#8221; as Geraldo put it, of scandal and disgrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of Congressman Weiner, I certainly understand not what a he did, but what happens to you after that,&#8221; Barry said. &#8220;Your family suffers from it, your wife suffers from it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cbs-bob-schieffer-slams-sickening-weiner-new-age-flasher-who-traded-raincoat-for-digital-camera/" target="_blank">CBS’ Bob Schieffer Slams ‘Sickening’ Weiner: ‘New Age Flasher’ Who ‘Traded Raincoat For Digital Camera’</a></strong></p>
<p>This considered advice from the mayor followed a testy exchange with Rivera after the host characterized Barry&#8217;s scandal as &#8220;much worse&#8221; than Weiner&#8217;s or San Diego Mayor <strong>Bob Filner&#8217;</strong>s, noting that Barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine and &#8220;got reelected mayor anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barry did not appreciate this summary, arguing that he&#8217;d never smoked crack cocaine, but that he didn&#8217;t know what he had smoked in the incident that led to his arrest. &#8220;You bought crack from crack dealers and you were smoking it and you didn&#8217;t know what it was?&#8221; Rivera asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you stop this bullsh*t about me doing something that&#8217;s not factual?&#8221; Barry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to apologize to our viewers for the obscenity you just uttered?&#8221; Rivera asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I got upset,&#8221; Barry said. &#8220;When people lie like you just did, I get upset.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fox-Marijuana.jpg" alt="" title="Fox Marijuana" width="320" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1374591" />Bishop <strong>Brad Allen</strong>, a frequent Fox News Channel guest and substance addiction recovery advocate, appeared on <em>Fox &#038; Friends</em> on Monday where he exploded over a pro-marijuana advertisement which aired on mobile screen at a recent NASCAR event. Allen called the ad “horrible” and suggested the firm which produced the ad be sued for false advertisement. He wondered if NSACAR could also be culpable for having colluded with the firm that produced the pro-Marijuana ad. <br clear="all" /></p>
<p>The ad in question, produced by Marijuana Project, claimed that the intoxicating substance is “less harmful than alcohol.” It claimed also that marijuana contains no calories, does not result in hangovers, and is not associated with violent or self-endangering behaviors. </p>
<p>“I have to first tell you this ad is certainly outright fabrication, misleading,” Allen began. “And Marijuana Project should be sued for false advertisement.”</p>
<p><a class="related-post" href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-steve-king-immigrants-mostly-evil-marijuana-smugglers-with-calves-the-size-of-cantaloupes/" target="_blank"><strong>RELATED Rep. Steve King: Immigrants Mostly ‘Evil’ Marijuana-Smugglers With ‘Calves the Size of Cantaloupes’</strong></a></p>
<p>“What a horrible thing to do and NASCAR claiming they missed this,” he continued. “We are really wondering if they could have been in cahoots with this advertisement.”</p>
<p>“Very, very bad – very, very bad thing to happen,” Allen opined. </p>
<p>Allen said that he expects the producers of a “family event” to exercise better judgment when choosing advertisers. “We could completely understand that beer cannot be a &#8212; marijuana cannot be the next beer,” he added. </p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re precisely the same people who are unwilling to cut the spending, and they&#8217;re, &#8216;Gimme, gimme, gimme, give me all my Sandy money now,&#8217;&#8221; Paul said, referring to last year&#8217;s drama over Hurricane Sandy relief funds, on which both King and Christie were quite vocal. &#8220;Those are the people who are bankrupting the government and not letting enough money be left over for national defense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, Christie called Paul&#8217;s brand of libertarianism &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/chris-christie-rand-pauls-brand-of-libertarianism-a-very-dangerous-thought/" target="_blank">a very dangerous thought</a>,&#8221; and chastised that wing of the GOP for their &#8220;esoteric, intellectual debates.&#8221; Yesterday, King accused Paul of &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-peter-king-blasts-rand-paul-for-apologizing-for-america-fringes-will-destroy-gop/" target="_blank">apologizing for America</a>&#8221; through his isolationist tendencies, and said &#8220;fringes&#8221; like Paul could harm the GOP in 2016.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/the-five-takes-sides-in-gops-christie-vs-paul-fight-best-thing-that-could-happen-to-the-left/" target="_blank">RELATED: The Five Takes Sides In GOP’s Christie Vs. Paul Fight: ‘Best Thing That Could Happen To The Left’</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind spying on terrorists,&#8221; Paul said Sunday, reaffirming his stance on expansive national security programs. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t like spying on all Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul also noted that his anti-surveillance policies speak to young voters. &#8220;If you talk about some privacy issues like that, I think you will find youth coming to you,&#8221; Paul said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/url6.jpeg" alt="" title="url" width="320" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1374331" />In what the <em>Associated Press</em> is calling a &#8220;remarkably open and wide-ranging news conference&#8221; aboard the papal airplane leaving in Rio de Janeiro en route to the Vatican, <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=pope+francis" target="_blank">Pope Francis</a></strong> indicated that gay priests should be accepted into the Catholic Church and their sins &#8220;forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?&#8221; Francis said.</p>
<p>This position is quite a change from the Church&#8217;s previous doctrine, authored by Francis&#8217; predecessor <strong>Pope Benedict</strong>, that those with &#8220;deep rooted homosexual tendencies&#8221; should not be allowed into the Church.</p>
<p>This announcement also comes amidst persistent rumors of a scandal within the Vatican involving gay priests and blackmail, one that the pontiff himself referred to in a <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/pope-francis-caught-citing-gay-lobby-during-off-record-meeting-stream-of-corruption-leaves-vatican-vulnerable/" target="_blank">off-the-record moment in June</a> when he referenced a &#8220;gay lobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again, these are all things you missed if you skipped the trip to Rio and got time off purgatory by <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/vatican-offers-time-off-purgatory-for-following-pope-francis-on-twitter/" target="_blank">following the Pope&#8217;s visit on Twitter</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PicMonkey-Collage8.jpg8-300x210.jpg" alt="" title="hannity rush" width="300" height="210" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1374171" /><strong>Cumulus Media</strong>, the second-biggest radio broadcaster in the country, will be dropping <strong>Rush Limbaugh</strong> and <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> from its stations by the end of the year. <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/07/cumulus-planning-to-drop-rush-limbaugh-sean-hannity-169371.html#.UfWxAAR0nQU.twitter" target="_blank">POLITICO reports that</a> negotiations broke down between Cumulus and the conservative hosts&#8217; radio distributor Premiere Networks over distribution rights.</p>
<p>Back in March, Cumulus Media CEO <strong>Lew Dickey</strong> admitted that they were <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/radio-network-ceo-limbaughs-sandra-fluke-comments-are-still-causing-problems-with-advertisers/" target="_blank">still having problems</a> with advertisers over Limbaugh&#8217;s <strong>Sandra Fluke</strong> comments over a year after he made them. As a result, Limbaugh <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/rush-limbaugh-leaving-cumulus-host-reportedly-in-dispute-with-network-over-sandra-fluke-fallout/" target="_blank">was reportedly considering</a> cutting his ties to Cumulus, around the same time <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/mediaite-learns-vast-majority-of-national-advertisers-now-refuse-to-air-ads-during-limbaughs-show/" target="_blank">Mediaite learned from an insider</a> that &#8220;the vast majority of national advertisers now refuse to air their ads during Rush Limbaugh’s show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether Limbaugh was still considering to depart or not, Cumulus has preempted any potential move on his part by ending its relationship with the two Clear Channel hosts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cumulus has decided that it will not renew its contracts with either host, the source said, a move that would remove the two most highly rated conservative talk personalities from more than 40 Cumulus channels in major markets&#8230;</p>
<p>As industry insiders caution, Cumulus and Clear Channel have come to the brink before during contract negotiations only to resume talks. But the source told POLITICO that Clear Channel was unlikely to reduce the cost for distribution rights to a level that would satisfy Cumulus.</p></blockquote>
<p>No one involved in the story (Cumulus, Premiere, spokespeople for Hannity and Limbaugh) has made a comment to POLITICO yet. It was <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/report-48-of-50-top-advertisers-exclude-rush-and-hannity-from-radio-commercial-buys/" target="_blank">reported in May that</a> 48 out of Cumulus&#8217; 50 top advertisers &#8220;exclude Rush and Hannity&#8221; from their ad buys (although Clear Channel denied it at the time).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dongoldiebill.jpg" alt="" title="dongoldiebill" width="320" height="220" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1374021" />Talk about strange bedfellows. </p>
<p>CNN and Fox News are rivals. </p>
<p>So are CNN and MSNBC. </p>
<p>And no one needs reminding of <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-chief-phil-griffin-believes-he-can-beat-loserville-fox-news-by-2014/" target="_blank">the warm feelings </a>MSNBC and Fox have for each other. </p>
<p>But with Fox winning the ratings race, jockeying for second place is the hottest ticket on the cable news fight card, at least for now. </p>
<p>MSNBC jumped into this position after a relatively stellar 2012, primarily thanks to the Presidential Election and the performance of its own horse in that race. But 2013—a non-election year—it’s been a whole new ballgame, as CNN has greatly benefitted from focusing on news that is much less political and much more in the human-interest domain: Boston bombings, Cleveland kidnappings, Oklahoma tornado, <strong>George Zimmerman</strong>, and the future <strong>King George</strong>. </p>
<p>Still, it is odd to see CNN’s<strong> Don Lemon</strong>, a black, gay, increasingly opinionated anchor <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnns-don-lemon-backs-up-bill-oreilly-he-doesnt-go-far-enough-in-criticizing-black-culture/" target="_blank">jump to the defense of Fox’s Bill O’Reilly</a>, a white, heterosexual, always-opinionated host, and his commentary on race. </p>
<p>To review for those not familiar with the story, Lemon stated on his show Saturday that not only did he agree with O’Reilly’s candid perspective on race, but from his perspective, O’Reilly hadn’t gone far enough. In short, O’Reilly <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/oreilly-smacks-down-obamas-race-speech-president-has-no-clue-how-to-combat-gangsta-culture/" target="_blank">said that</a> black communities were struggling because of a breakdown of the family unit. Lemon obviously heard these remarks and played them on his show, which, again…is like Pepsi (CNN) serving Coke (Fox) at a corporate picnic: “Raised without much structure, young black men often reject education and gravitate towards the street culture, drugs, hustling, gangs.” </p>
<p>Tagging out of the clip, Lemon said, “Bill’s got a point. In fact, he’s got more than a point … In my estimation, he doesn’t go far enough.”</p>
<p>Unfiltered and brave commentary, considering the source (a host from a competing network), and also considering the backlash Lemon absolutely knew a defense of the conservative O’Reilly would create. On Sunday, he <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-fires-back-at-critics-%e2%80%98uncle-tom%e2%80%99-label-whats-wrong-with-telling-people-to-dress-appropriately%e2%80%99/" target="_blank">shared just how deep </a>the vitriol has already become.</p>
<p>Leading the charge against Lemon is MSNBC in the form of <strong>Goldie Taylor</strong>. But first (earlier in the week), <strong>Chris Hayes</strong>—who knows all about struggles of a different kind since moving to prime time and promptly occupying fourth place on most nights—continued his transformation from sober and civilized to awkward and confrontational by taking a page from the <em>Olbermann</em> playbook <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-hayes-blasts-bill-oreillys-super-racist-rant-maybe-problem-is-white-culture/" target="_blank">by calling O’Reilly’s memo</a> a “super racist rant.” </p>
<p><strong>Al Sharpton</strong>—who would never, <em>ever</em> try to exploit or ferment racial tensions—<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/sharpton-fires-back-at-oreilly-since-when-are-you-the-expert-on-what-african-americans-want/" target="_blank">also got into the act</a>, declaring “we need a real conversation about justice in this country, not the same old right-wing divide and conquer garbage. Bill O’Reilly, the Willie Horton stuff has got to go.” In an unrelated story, the &#8220;Willie Horton stuff&#8221; came the same year Tawana Brawley falsely accused six white men of rape. So Sharpton already knows a thing or two about that whole dividing and conquering garbage. </p>
<p>Anyway, since Hayes and Sharpton don’t have a weekend show to respond to Lemon (but you can bet it’s coming on Monday), enter Taylor via Twitter <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/tweetnado-msnbcs-goldie-taylor-calls-don-lemon-a-turn-coat-mofo/" target="_blank">to bring a whole new level of civility </a>to the conversation: </p>
<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mofo.jpg" alt="" title="mofo" width="474" height="199" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1374031" /></p>
<p>In Taylor’s world, of course, <em>individual opinions </em>aren’t valued…it’s all about uniformity of sentiment along racial lines. It’s also apparently a place where &#8220;turncoat&#8221; is no longer one word (saving characters wherever possible is key on Twitter). </p>
<p>In terms of backlash, Lemon is already finding out what <strong>Charles Barkley </strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/charles-barkley-agrees-with-zimmerman-verdict-hits-media-for-giving-racists-a-platform-to-vent-ignorance/" target="_blank">did last week</a>: Broach anything related to black-on-black crime or racism within the black community itself, and be prepared to be called an Uncle Tom or a turncoat mofo. </p>
<p>Monday will be an interesting day on all the cable networks. On Fox, it is fairly certain O’Reilly will play Lemon’s comments. On CNN, Lemon will again respond to his critics as the story may expand to other shows, other hosts. And on MSNBC, minus an election and any pesky breaking news getting in the way of this discussion, race will once be the soup of the day, as has been the case for about the past 60 days or so&#8230; </p>
<p>Lost in the cacophony, of course, is Lemon’s list from Saturday of five things that members of all races “should think about doing,” including (paraphrased): </p>
<p>- Respecting communities by not dropping trash on the ground or ignoring trash already there<br />
- Fighting poverty by finishing school (Lemon compared earning potential between high school dropouts, high school graduates and college graduates)<br />
- Pulling up sagging pants as a sign of self-respect<br />
- Elimination of the ‘n’ word from any discourse<br />
- Addressing the issue of absentee fathers (Lemon cited a stat showing 72 percent of all African-Americans babies are born to unwed moms) </p>
<p>Basic stuff, but powerful. And a rarity given all the sizzle and lack of steak that conversations on cable news have become.</p>
<p>In one corner: Don Lemon and Bill O’Reilly, which is the most unlikely duo we&#8217;ve seen on any screen since <strong>Eddie Murphy </strong>and <strong>Nick Nolte</strong>. </p>
<p>In the other corner: Goldie Taylor, Chris Hayes and Al Sharpton. </p>
<p>Monday will be an interesting day indeed…</p>

Case in point, a Florida sex offender recently released from prison after 13 years was arrested again on charges he tried to molest his neighbor&#8217;s dog.</p>
<p><strong>James Lee Lyons</strong> was arrested by detectives from the St. Johns County Sheriff&#8217;s office after his neighbor told them he witnessed Lyons taking his dog, only to claim that he just found the dog in the shed, but the neighbor had already checked the shed and was suspicious. <a href="http://staugustine.com/news/police/2013-07-26/man-arrested-charge-sexual-activity-involving-animal#.UfWuAR_d2Qi" target="_blank">According to <em>The St. Augustine Record</em></a>, an emergency veterinarian who examined the dog &#8220;suspected animal abuse and bestiality,&#8221; and Lyons was quickly arrested.</p>
<p>Lyons was officially charged with &#8220;animal cruelty and sexual activity involving an animal,&#8221; and <a href="http://www.actionnewsjax.com/content/topstories/story/Registered-sexual-predator-arrested-on-bestiality/5jbLrZ_LGkm4BQYzKAvm-Q.cspx" target="_blank">as WTEV reports</a>, the neighbor not only noticed that the dog was acting differently, but that there were &#8220;injuries to the dogs [sic] rectum and vulva.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyons <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2013-07-26/story/st-johns-sex-predator-charged-having-sex-neighbors-dog" target="_blank">was released from prison</a> in 2011, after serving 13 years for attempted sexual battery on a child and sexual act with a child in 1998.</p>

<p><strong>LZ Granderson</strong> told Lemon how he had to explain the to his own son why he shouldn&#8217;t go out wearing saggy pants in public, saying that young black man can still express themselves creatively without linking themselves to that history.</p>
<p><strong><a class="related-post" href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnn-guest-rips-don-lemons-race-remarks-sound-like-conservative-preacher-oreilly-should-welcome-you/">RELATED: CNN Guest Rips Don Lemon’s Race Remarks: ‘Sound Like Conservative Preacher, O’Reilly Should Welcome You’</a></strong></p>
<p>Lemon directly took on the critics of his remarks Saturday.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is wrong with telling people to dress appropriately? These are things that I said yesterday that my mom taught me in kindergarten&#8230; Dress nicely, speak well, speak appropriately.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Ana Navarro</strong> acknowledged the &#8220;Twitter hate&#8221; Lemon got for his remarks, adding that &#8220;success is not going to be reached by not speaking English correctly&#8221; and all Lemon was doing was giving &#8220;tough love&#8221; and &#8220;constructive criticism&#8221; to the black community. Lemon defended his other coverage of race in America, touting panels and discussions he&#8217;s done on racial privilege, racism, and profiling.</p>
<p>Lemon also brought up the special he did on the n-word a few weeks ago, and explained that he actually got threatened for telling a black mother she shouldn&#8217;t use the word to her child. Granderson allowed that there&#8217;s a certain level of context that needs to be understood in talking about the n-word, but he said the bottom line is that when people walk around with saggy pants and dropping the n-word, they likely won&#8217;t get a good job or a &#8220;decent date with anyone worth loving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lemon asked Granderson, &#8220;You know what you sound like right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Granderson asked back, &#8220;Like a reasonable human being?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lemon brought up the &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; moniker that&#8217;s been thrown his way. Lemon concluded that the bottom line is that &#8220;it&#8217;s really just about respecting yourself.&#8221; Lemon said, &#8220;You have to make a decision at some point that you are going to be better than your surroundings and your circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>King has been in hot water over his comments about drug-smuggling illegal immigrants with &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-steve-king-immigrants-mostly-evil-marijuana-smugglers-with-calves-the-size-of-cantaloupes/" target="_blank">calves the size of cantaloupes</a>.&#8221; Despite criticism from leaders of his own party, including <strong>John Boehner</strong> and <strong>Eric Cantor</strong>, King <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/steve-king-claims-gop-privately-agrees-with-cantaloupes-comment-but-afraid-of-repercussions/" target="_blank">refused to apologize for them</a>.</p>

Steve King’s ‘Offensive’ Remarks: ‘Beneath The Dignity Of’ Congress</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to commend Congressman King,&#8221; Navarro said Sunday, &#8220;the King from New York, who&#8217;s actually the King that I like, and I want to commend Speaker Boehner, Representative Cantor, for having come out this week and done what they&#8217;ve had to do: show leadership and speak and denounce the hateful, ignorant rhetoric of Steve King.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is enough. We have had enough of this man. He does not define the Republican Party. I think there&#8217;s many more Peter Kings, many more John Boehners in Congress, than there are Steve Kings. He is a mediocre congressman, who makes news only when he says something this inflammatory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Navarro agreed with with Peter King from an earlier segment, when he said that the many divisions within the Republican Party would be smoothed out by 2016. &#8220;Congressman King is absolutely right, that Republicans are going to decide in the next two and a half years, as we go, and have a nominee who is going to carry them and be a standard bearer,&#8221; Navarro said.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[On CNN's <em>State of the Union</em> Sunday morning, Congressman <strong>Peter King</strong> strongly urged certain members of the Republican Party to back away from their recent rhetoric threatening to shut down the government over either the funding of Obamacare or the extension of the debt ceiling. "There's no reason to be threatening to bring down the government," King said. "American people get turned off with the threat of terror politics."]]></description>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to be threatening to bring down the government,&#8221; King said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s make this work, let&#8217;s get the spending cuts we need. But American people get turned off with the threat of terror politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not be closing down the government under any circumstances. That doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s wrong. Obamacare passed. We have to try to defund it, we have to try to find ways to repeal it. The fact is, we shouldn&#8217;t be using it as a threat to shut down the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>King also sounded cautiously optimistic on the prospects of immigration reform in the House. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have to show good faith in trying to find legislation that works, and I think we are going in that direction,&#8221; King said. &#8220;The President had four years on immigration, and did absolutely nothing. I would say you&#8217;ve seen a lot of movement in the past six months. The Senate, with strong Republican help, a bill did pass. I don&#8217;t fully agree with that bill, but I think we can find ways to make that bill work. You do find people in the House willing to make it work.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/url-14.jpeg" alt="" title="url-1" width="320" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1372971" />According to the D.C. police, a robbery over the weekend in Adams Morgan, a diverse and popular area of Washington, D.C., is being investigated as a potential hate crime after one of the assailants reportedly invoked <strong>Trayvon Martin</strong> during the incident.</p>
<p>Authorities say three black men approached a white man on Saturday and mugged him, kicking him and stealing his iPhone. During the robbery, one of the men allegedly said, &#8220;This is for Trayvon Martin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man suffered some minor injuries, but apparently did not accept medical treatment. Though no arrests have been made, authorities are investigating the matter as a potential hate crime. </p>
<p>The robbery comes two weeks after the acquittal of <strong>George Zimmerman</strong> in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, which ignited a firestorm of debate over race, and led some to believe that the verdict would be followed by riots.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Capture40.jpg" alt="" title="Capture" width="320" height="220" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1373131" />Mediaite&#8217;</em>s own <strong>Joe Concha</strong> appeared on CNN&#8217;s <em>Reliable Sources</em> Sunday afternoon to provide the American perspective on why CNN got the biggest boost from the royal baby coverage, and why the cable news networks will tread lightly in their coverage from here on out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fox and MSNBC got a first trimester bump,&#8221; Concha said, &#8220;just a small one, barerly noticeable. But CNN seemed to put more resources toward the story. They&#8217;re doing more human interest stories now, particularly during a non-election year. As a result, they preempted, for instance, their 10 p.m. show often, and they doubled their ratings in that slot for a show called <em>Will And Kate Plus One</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is in America, it was embraced,&#8221; Concha said. &#8220;We still yearn for the class of the Brits. The royal families are the Bushes, the Clintons, and of course the Kardashians with special guests <strong>Kanye West</strong> and North West, so I think we have to go across the pond to get that class and dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The panel also discussed whether the press will be careful not intrude too far into the lives of the royal couple, especially with the backdrop of the invasive bugging scandal that has come to light in Britain in the past two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two people, and eventually the baby, are so likable, they&#8217;re like the opposite of the Weiners,&#8221; Concha said. &#8220;Therefore, I don&#8217;t think the press is going to go after them as hard, because Kate has such sympathy. She&#8217;s such a likable peson, that family is so likable, that I think coverage is for the most part going to be good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had those Australian DJs that did that prank call that eventually forced that nurse to commit suicide,&#8221; Concha added. &#8220;I think the media is very careful about, &#8216;Hey let&#8217;s not screw with these guys,&#8217; becuase again, they are so likable that we don&#8217;t want to have any negative coverage, to be seen as harassing them.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/aslan.jpg" alt="" title="aslan" width="320" height="211" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1372651" />On the FoxNews.com show <em>Spirited Debate</em>, host <strong>Lauren Green</strong> repeatedly questioned the motives guest <strong>Reza Aslan</strong>, a Muslim and author of <em>Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth</em>, had in writing a scholarly text about the historical Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be clear, I am a scholar of religions with four degrees including one in the New Testament and fluency of biblical Greek, who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades, who also just happens to be a Muslim,&#8221; Aslan said. </p>
<p>&#8220;It still begs the question though: why would you be interested in the founder of Christianity?&#8221; Green asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s my job as an academic,&#8221; Aslan said. &#8220;I am a professor of religion, including the New Testament. That&#8217;s what I do for a living.&#8221;</p>
<p>Green continued to ask Aslan about his motives, as Aslan grew more and more impatient with her imputations. &#8220;There are those who do not like the book, who are unhappy with its general arguments, and that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Aslan said. &#8220;But I do think it&#8217;s perhaps a little bit strange that rather than debating the arguments of the book, we are debating the right of the scholar to actually write it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point, Green quoted a critic of Aslan&#8217;s who said a Muslim writing a book about Jesus would be like a Democrat writing a book about why <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong> wasn&#8217;t a good Republican. </p>
<p>&#8220;It would be like a Democrat with a PhD in Reagan who has been studying his life and history for two decades writing about Reagan,&#8221; Aslan responded. &#8220;I think that the fundamental problem here is that you&#8217;re assuming that I have some sort of faith-based bias. I write about Judaism, I write about Hinduism, I write about Christianity, I write about Islam. My job as a scholar with a PhD in the subject is to write about religion<em>S</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally Green accused him of hiding his faith. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been on several programs and never disclosed that you&#8217;re a Muslim,&#8221; she said, to which Aslan responded that his biography is on the second page of his book and stated in every interview.</p>
<p>For those curious, the conclusion Aslan came to about Jesus was that he was &#8220;a real political revolutionary, who took on the powers of his time on behalf of the poor, the meek, the dispossessed the marginalized, who sacrificed himself in his for those who couldn&#8217;t stand up for themselves.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/will-316x2091.jpg" alt="" title="will-316x209" width="316" height="209" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1373561" />A panel on <em>This Week With George Stephanopoulos</em> went at each other over the possibility of federal intervention in Detroit&#8217;s bankruptcy, with the discussion growing especially heated after <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=george+will" target="_blank">George Will</a></strong> suggested that Detroit&#8217;s &#8220;cultural problems,&#8221; including unwed mothers, were to blame for the city&#8217;s financial ruin.</p>
<p>“Eighty percent of the pain in this restructuring is being borne by the workers and the retirees if this plan goes through,&#8221; argued <strong>Steve Rattner</strong>, who oversaw the auto bailout and argued in an op-ed last week that the government should assist the city itself. “Detroit needs investment, and that’s where the federal government and the state, particularly, can and should help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t solve their problems because their problems are cultural,&#8221; Will said. “You have a city, 139 square miles, you can graze cattle in vast portions of it. Dangerous herds of feral dogs roam in there. You have three percent of fourth graders reading at the national math standards. 47% of Detroit residents are functionally illiterate. 79% of Detroit children are born to unmarried mothers. They don’t have a fiscal problem, Steve, they have a cultural collapse.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I find that really insulting to the people of Detroit,” said <strong>Katrina vanden Heuvel</strong>. “There is a serious discussion about the future of cities in a time of deindustrialization, but in many ways, Detroit has been a victim of market forces. I think that what Steve said is so critical, that retirees and workers should not bear this. This story should not be hijacked as one of about greedy, fiscal public unions.”</p>
<p>&#8220;What Steve said in his op-ed was that the people in Detroit are no more to blame than the victims of Hurricane Sandy because apart from voting—well what did they vote for?&#8221; Will said. &#8220;For sixty years they voted for incompetents, malcontents and in some cases criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So what do you want to do?&#8221; Rattner responded. &#8220;Do you want to leave them sitting in exactly the situation you just described. Or in the spirit of America, trying to help people who are less fortunate—whether they&#8217;re victims of natural disasters or their own ignorance or whatever—do you want to reach out and try to help them, and try to reinvent Detroit? For not a lot of money. We&#8217;re talking about a couple billion dollars. This is small potatoes in the great scheme of life. Or we have your scenario, leave them all to sit with feral dogs for the rest of their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hobbesian anarchy,&#8221; vanden Heuvel said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/schieffer1.jpg" alt="" title="schieffer" width="320" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1372071" />&#8220;What can be said about the <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=anthony+weiner" target="_blank">Anthony Weiner</a></strong> affair that hasn&#8217;t been said before?&#8221; <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=bob+schieffer" target="_blank">Bob Schieffer</a></strong> asked at the start of his weekly commentary Sunday morning. &#8220;Actually several things. One, it is not funny, it is sickening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, it is important. The mayor of New York is not only the most powerful municipal post in America, but because New York is so big and is the media capital of the world, the mayor of New York occupies a bully pulpit, second in bullyishness only to that of the White House. The rest of us may not like it, but what the mayor of New York says matters far beyond the New York City limits. Which is why someone with Anthony Weiner&#8217;s problems has no business there and should leave the race,&#8221; Schieffer said, becoming <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/weiner-count-a-growing-list-of-people-who-want-carlos-danger-to-drop-out-of-nyc-mayoral-race/#0" target="_blank">yet another national figure to call for Weiner&#8217;s exit</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/david-axelrod-shows-anthony-weiner-the-door-its-time-for-him-to-go-away-he-is-wasting-time-and-space/" target="_blank">RELATED: David Axelrod Shows Anthony Weiner The Door: ‘It’s Time For Him To Go Away, He Is Wasting Time And Space’</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony Weiner is not an entertaining kook,&#8221; Schieffer continued. &#8220;He is a new age flasher who has traded the traditional raincoat that can be opened to show his wares for a digital camera that enables him to expose himself to the world—a dubious technological achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would anyone put themselves and their loved ones through something like this? I wouldn&#8217;t pretend to know. But a friend of a friend said in today&#8217;s world there are those who value power above dignity. That&#8217;s probably right, but even in politics I want to believe they are still a minority.&#8221;</p>

<p>Queen Creek High School held the day in the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the A&#038;E show <em>Duck Dynasty</em>. But after at least one student wore a confederate flag to school, local civil rights groups, church leaders, and fellow students objected.</p>
<p>Reverend Jarrett Maupin was one of several figures to bring the issue to the attention of the Department of Education, which he said will &#8220;determine the remedy, including moderating conversations between school administrators and civil rights community leaders to shape new policy and racism prevention measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This thing really got to Marcus,” Reverend Ozetta Kirby said about his grandson, a student at the high school. “When you’re in 11th grade, that can break you down and make you feel at the bottom rung of the whole society, where everybody is being jubilant. No kid should have to go through that. We all know the connotation of ‘redneck.’”</p>
<p>Do they? A&#038;E produced a promo spot about the controversy, stating, &#8220;Around these parts, every day is redneck day.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dyson.jpg" alt="" title="dyson" width="320" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1371671" /><strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=melissa+harris-perry" target="_blank">Melissa Harris-Perry</a></strong> and her panel took on <strong>Tim Allen&#8217;</strong>s recent argument that white comedians should use the word &#8220;nigger&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;n-word,&#8221; arguing that the euphemism has become more offensive than the word itself. Harris-Perry commended Allen for showing &#8220;some thoughtfulness&#8221; in his remarks, but the panel still took issue with Allen&#8217;s presumptuousness, with <strong><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/?s=michael+eric+dyson" target="_blank">Michael Eric Dyson</a></strong> savaging Allen for &#8220;wanting back in&#8221; on a word white people invented for the sole purpose of subjugating African Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to move from ally to reassume the appropriate privilege of whiteness, which is to dictate the terms of the debate,&#8221; Dyson said. &#8220;Look, y&#8217;all invented the n-word. We didn&#8217;t invent it. We just co-opted it. We hijacked it. We did a carjacking on that word a few decades ago, and now you&#8217;re mad because we&#8217;ve made more sexy use of it—some denigration as well. And now you want back in? No, you can&#8217;t have back in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to infantlize white people,&#8221; Dyson continued. &#8220;He says it&#8217;s confusing to me. It ain&#8217;t confusing! Here&#8217;s a general rule of thumb to follow when using the n-word for white people. <em>Never</em>. When you do that, then you understand you can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And finally what&#8217;s interesting here is that using this kind of word—as <strong>Chris Rock</strong> said, white people control the whole world but they feel if they can&#8217;t use the n-word, somehow their power has been removed? No! Grow up, allow us to determine what is in and out. As a result of that, be our ally and challenge white people not to use it at home. You&#8217;re already using it. You just want to use it in public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen had made the argument that the use of the word would better distinguish lack of racist intent, a point with which <strong>Jonathan Rosa</strong>, an assistant professor of anthropology at UMass Amherst, strongly disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Tim Allen wants to carve out a space for himself in which he can use language however he wants, go for it and try it out and see if that works, and see how it&#8217;s received, right?&#8221; Rosa said. &#8220;But this notion that &#8216;You know what&#8217;s in my heart, you know what I really believe,&#8217; is not entirely unlike <strong>Rand Paul&#8217;</strong>s commentary, &#8216;I don&#8217;t have a racist bone in my body, so if you know what&#8217;s really in my heart, then I can say whatever I want.&#8217; Which really undermines the idea that language shows us what&#8217;s in your heart, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t really commented on this because Huma [Abedin] is a friend of mine, his wife, and I deeply respect her,&#8221; said Axelrod. &#8220;But at this point, it&#8217;s absurd. He is not going to be the next mayor of New York. He is wasting time and space.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Americans believe second chances, but not third chances,&#8221; Axelrod said. &#8220;You asked at the beginning, when will voters say enough? I remember an old song from the 1970s that I loved, called, &#8216;How can I miss you when you won&#8217;t go away?&#8217; I think that they think it&#8217;s time for him to go away, and let New York have its mayor&#8217;s race.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Axelrod, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>New York Daily News</em>, and others have already called <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/weiner-count-a-growing-list-of-people-who-want-carlos-danger-to-drop-out-of-nyc-mayoral-race/#0" target="_blank">for Weiner to bow out</a>.</p>
<p>Weiner&#8217;s campaign manager <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/weiners-campaign-manager-quits-after-sexting-revelations/" target="_blank">quit over the weekend</a>, reportedly because of <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/weiner-admits-recent-sexting-hopes-new-yorkers-still-willing-to-give-him-second-chance-in-press-conference/" target="_blank">the sexting revelations</a> that sent Weiner&#8217;s campaign back into the tawdry territory out of which it had so recently climbed.</p>
