          <p>
            All Americans should be regularly physically active to improve overall
		health and fitness and to prevent many adverse health outcomes. The benefits of
		physical activity occur in generally healthy people, in people at risk of
		developing chronic diseases, and in people with current chronic conditions or
		disabilities. This chapter gives an overview of research findings on physical
		activity and health. The box below provides a summary of these benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physical activity affects many health conditions, and the specific
		amounts and types of activity that benefit each condition vary. In developing
		public health guidelines, the challenge is to integrate scientific information
		across all health benefits and identify a critical range of physical activity
		that appears to have an effect across the health benefits. One consistent
		finding from research studies is that once the health benefits from physical
		activity begin to accrue, additional amounts of activity provide additional
		benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although some health benefits seem to begin with as little as 60
		minutes (1 hour) a week, research shows that a total amount of 150 minutes (2
		hours and 30 minutes) a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as
		brisk walking, consistently reduces the risk of many chronic diseases and other
		adverse health outcomes.
          </p>
          <h3>Examining the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Health</h3>
          <p>
            In many studies covering a wide range of issues, researchers have
		focused on <strong>exercise</strong>, as well as on the more broadly defined
		concept of physical activity. Exercise is a form of physical activity that is
		planned, structured, repetitive, and performed with the goal of improving
		health or fitness. So, although all exercise is physical activity, not all
		physical activity is exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Studies have examined the role of physical activity in many
		groups—men and women, children, teens, adults, older adults, people with
		disabilities, and women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. These
		studies have focused on the role that physical activity plays in many health
		outcomes, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="first">Premature (early) death; </li>
            <li>Diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, some cancers, type 2
		  diabetes, osteoporosis, and depression; </li>
            <li>Risk factors for disease, such as high blood pressure and high blood
		  cholesterol; </li>
            <li><strong>Physical fitness</strong>, such as <strong>aerobic
		  capacity</strong>, and muscle <strong>strength</strong> and endurance</li>
            <li>Functional capacity (the ability to engage in activities needed for
		  daily living); </li>
            <li>Mental health, such as depression and cognitive function; and </li>
            <li class="last">Injuries or sudden heart attacks. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These studies have also prompted questions as to what type and how much
		physical activity is needed for various health benefi ts. To answer this
		question, investigators have studied three main kinds of physical activity:
		aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bonestrengthening. Investigators have also
		studied balance and fl exibility activities. These latter two activities are
		addressed in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.

          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Aerobic Activity</h4>
          <p>
            In this kind of physical activity (also called an <strong>endurance
		activity</strong> or cardio activity), the body's large muscles move in a
		rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time. Brisk walking, running,
		bicycling, jumping rope, and swimming are all examples.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aerobic activity causes a person's heart to beat faster than usual.
          </p>
          <p>Aerobic physical activity has three components: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="first"><strong>Intensity</strong>, or how hard a person works to do the
		  activity. The intensities most often examined are moderate intensity
		  (equivalent in effort to brisk walking) and vigorous intensity (equivalent in
		  effort to running or jogging); </li>
            <li><strong>Frequency</strong>, or how often a person does aerobic
		  activity; and </li>
            <li class="last"><strong>Duration</strong>, or how long a person does an activity in
		  any one session. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although these components make up a physical activity profile, research
		has shown that the total amount of physical activity (minutes of
		moderate–intensity physical activity, for example) is more important for
		achieving health benefits than is any one component (frequency, intensity, or
		duration).
          </p>
          <h4>Muscle-Strengthening Activity</h4>
          <p>
            This kind of activity, which includes <strong>resistance
		training</strong> and lifting weights, causes the body's muscles to work or
		hold against an applied force or weight. These activities often involve
		relatively heavy objects, such as weights, which are lifted multiple times to
		train various muscle groups. Muscle-strengthening activity can also be done by
		using elastic bands or body weight for resistance (climbing a tree or doing
		push-ups, for example).
          </p>
          <p>Muscle-strengthening activity also has three components: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="first"><strong>Intensity</strong>, or how much weight or force is used
		  relative to how much a person is able to lift; </li>
            <li><strong>Frequency</strong>, or how often a person does muscle
		  strengthening activity; and </li>
            <li class="last"><strong>Repetitions</strong>, or how many times a person lifts a
		  weight (analogous to duration for aerobic activity). The effects of
		  muscle-strengthening activity are limited to the muscles doing the work. It's
		  important to work all the major muscle groups of the body: the legs, hips,
		  back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Bone-Strengthening Activity</h4>
          <p>
            This kind of activity (sometimes called weight-bearing or
		weight-loading activity) produces a force on the bones that promotes bone
		growth and strength. This force is commonly produced by impact with the ground.
		Examples of bone-strengthening activity include jumping jacks, running, brisk
		walking, and weight-lifting exercises. As these examples illustrate,
		bone-strengthening activities can also be aerobic and muscle strengthening.
          </p>
          <h3>The Health Benefits of Physical Activity</h3>
          <p>
            Studies clearly demonstrate that participating in regular physical
		activity provides many health benefits. These benefits are summarized in the
		accompanying table. Many conditions affected by physical activity occur with
		increasing age, such as heart disease and cancer. Reducing risk of these
		conditions may require years of participation in regular physical activity.
		However, other benefits, such as increased <strong>cardiorespiratory
		fitness</strong>, increased muscular strength, and decreased depressive
		symptoms and blood pressure, require only a few weeks or months of
		participation in physical activity.

            <h3>
              The Beneficial Effects of Increasing Physical Activity: It's About
		  Overload, Progression, and Specificity
            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Overload</strong> is the physical stress placed on the body
		  when physical activity is greater in amount or intensity than usual. The body's
		  structures and functions respond and adapt to these stresses. For example,
		  aerobic physical activity places a stress on the cardiorespiratory system and
		  muscles, requiring the lungs to move more air and the heart to pump more blood
		  and deliver it to the working muscles. This increase in demand increases the
		  efficiency and capacity of the lungs, heart, circulatory system, and exercising
		  muscles. In the same way, muscle–strengthening and bone-strengthening
		  activities overload muscles and bones, making them stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Progression</strong> is closely tied to overload. Once a
		  person reaches a certain fitness level, he or she progresses to higher levels
		  of physical activity by continued overload and adaptation. Small, progressive
		  changes in overload help the body adapt to the additional stresses while
		  minimizing the risk of injury.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Specificity</strong> means that the benefits of physical
		  activity are specific to the body systems that are doing the work. For example,
		  aerobic physical activity largely benefits the body's cardiovascular system.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The health benefits of physical activity are seen in children and
		adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, older adults, women and men, people
		of different races and ethnicities, and people with disabilities and chronic
		conditions. The health benefits of physical activity are generally independent
		of body weight. Adults of all sizes and shapes gain health and fitness benefits
		by being habitually physically active. The benefits of physical activity also
		outweigh the risk of injury and sudden heart attacks, two concerns that prevent
		many people from becoming physically active.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following sections provide more detail on what is known from
		research studies about the specific health benefits of physical activity and
		how much physical activity is needed to get the health benefits.
          </p>
          <h4>Premature Death</h4>
          <p>
            Strong scientific evidence shows that physical activity reduces the
		risk of premature death (dying earlier than the average age of death for a
		specific population group) from the leading causes of death, such as heart
		disease and some cancers, as well as from other causes of death. This effect is
		remarkable in two ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="first">First, only a few lifestyle choices have as large an effect on
		  mortality as physical activity. It has been estimated that people who are
		  physically active for approximately 7 hours a week have a 40 percent lower risk
		  of dying early than those who are active for less than 30 minutes a week. </li>
            <li class="last">Second, it is not necessary to do high amounts of activity or
		  vigorous-intensity activity to reduce the risk of premature death. Studies show
		  substantially lower risk when people do 150 minutes of at least
		  moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity a week. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Research clearly demonstrates the importance of avoiding inactivity.
		Even low amounts of physical activity reduce the risk of dying prematurely. As
		the figure on page 11 shows, the most dramatic difference in risk is seen
		between those who are inactive (30 minutes a week) and those with low levels of
		activity (90 minutes or 1 hour and 30 minutes a week). The <strong>relative
		risk</strong> of dying prematurely continues to be lower with higher levels of
		reported moderate- or vigorous-intensity leisure-time physical activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            All adults can gain this health benefit of physical activity. Age,
		race, and ethnicity do not matter. Men and women younger than 65 years as well
		as older adults have lower rates of early death when they are physically active
		than when they are inactive. Physically active people of all body weights
		(normal weight, overweight, obese) also have lower rates of early death than do
		inactive people.

          <h4>Cardiorespiratory Health</h4>
          <p>
            The benefits of physical activity on cardiorespiratory health are some
		of the most extensively documented of all the health benefits.
		Cardiorespiratory health involves the health of the heart, lungs, and blood
		vessels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heart diseases and stroke are two of the leading causes of death in the
		United States. Risk factors that increase the likelihood of cardiovascular
		diseases include smoking, high blood pressure (called hypertension), type 2
		diabetes, and high levels of certain blood lipids (such as low-density
		lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol). Low cardiorespiratory fitness also is a risk
		factor for heart disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who do moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity
		have a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease than do inactive
		people. Regularly active adults have lower rates of heart disease and stroke,
		and have lower blood pressure, better blood lipid profiles, and fitness.
		Significant reductions in risk of cardiovascular disease occur at activity
		levels equivalent to 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical
		activity. Even greater benefits are seen with 200 minutes (3 hours and 20
		minutes) a week. The evidence is strong that greater amounts of physical
		activity result in even further reductions in the risk of cardiovascular
		disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone can gain the cardiovascular health benefits of physical
		activity. The amount of physical activity that provides favorable
		cardiorespiratory health and fitness outcomes is similar for adults of various
		ages, including older people, as well as for adults of various races and
		ethnicities. Aerobic exercise also improves cardiorespiratory fitness in
		individuals with some disabilities, including people who have lost the use of
		one or both legs and those with multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury,
		and cognitive disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moderate-intensity physical activity is safe for generally healthy
		women during pregnancy. It increases cardiorespiratory fitness without
		increasing the risk of early pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, or low birth
		weight. Physical activity during the postpartum period also improves
		cardiorespiratory fitness.
          </p>
          <h4>Metabolic Health</h4>
          <p>
            Regular physical activity strongly reduces the risk of developing type
		2 diabetes as well as the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is defined
		as a condition in which people have some combination of high blood pressure, a
		large waistline (abdominal obesity), an adverse blood lipid profile (low levels
		of high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, raised triglycerides), and
		impaired glucose tolerance.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who regularly engage in at least moderate intensity aerobic
		activity have a significantly lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than do
		inactive people. Although some experts debate the usefulness of defining the
		metabolic syndrome, good evidence exists that physical activity reduces the
		risk of having this condition, as defined in various ways. Lower rates of these
		conditions are seen with 120 to 150 minutes (2 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes)
		a week of at least moderate-intensity aerobic activity. As with cardiovascular
		health, additional levels of physical activity seem to lower risk even further.
		In addition, physical activity helps control blood glucose levels in persons
		who already have type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physical activity also improves metabolic health in youth. Studies find
		this effect when young people participate in at least 3 days of vigorous
		aerobic activity a week. More physical activity is associated with improved
		metabolic health, but research has yet to determine the exact amount of
		improvement.
          </p>
          <h4>Obesity and Energy Balance</h4>
          <p>
            Overweight and obesity occur when fewer calories are expended,
		including calories burned through physical activity, than are taken in through
		food and beverages. Physical activity and caloric intake both must be
		considered when trying to control body weight. Because of this role in energy
		balance, physical activity is a critical factor in determining whether a person
		can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain
		successful weight loss. People vary a great deal in how much physical activity
		they need to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Some need more physical
		activity than others to maintain a healthy body weight, to lose weight, or to
		keep weight off once it has been lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong scientific evidence shows that physical activity helps people
		maintain a stable weight over time. However, the optimal amount of physical
		activity needed to maintain weight is unclear. People vary greatly in how much
		physical activity results in weight stability. Many people need more than the
		equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to maintain
		their weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over short periods of time, such as a year, research shows that it is
		possible to achieve weight stability by doing the equivalent of 150 to 300
		minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity walking at about a 4
		mile-an-hour pace. Muscle-strengthening activities may help promote weight
		maintenance, although not to the same degree as aerobic activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who want to lose a substantial (more than 5 percent of body
		weight) amount of weight and people who are trying to keep a significant amount
		of weight off once it has been lost need a high amount of physical activity
		unless they also reduce their caloric intake. Many people need to do more than
		300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to meet weight–control
		goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular physical activity also helps control the percentage of body fat
		in children and adolescents. Exercise training studies with overweight and
		obese youth have shown that they can reduce their body fatness by participating
		in physical activity that is at least moderate intensity on 3 to 5 days a week,
		for 30 to 60 minutes each time.
          </p>
          <h4>Musculoskeletal Health</h4>
          <p>
            Bones, muscles, and joints support the body and help it move. Healthy
		bones, joints, and muscles are critical to the ability to do daily activities
		without physical limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preserving bone, joint, and muscle health is essential with increasing
		age. Studies show that the frequent decline in bone density that happens during
		aging can be slowed with regular physical activity. These effects are seen in
		people who participate in aerobic, muscle–strengthening, and
		bone-strengthening physical activity programs of moderate or vigorous
		intensity. The range of total physical activity for these benefits varies
		widely. Important changes seem to begin at 90 minutes a week and continue up to
		300 minutes a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hip fracture is a serious health condition that can have life-changing
		negative effects for many older people. Physically active people, especially
		women, appear to have a lower risk of hip fracture than do inactive people.
		Research studies on physical activity to prevent hip fracture show that
		participating in 120 to 300 minutes a week of physical activity that is of at
		least moderate intensity is associated with a reduced risk. It is unclear,
		however, whether activity also lowers risk of fractures of the spine or other
		important areas of the skeleton.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              The bottom line is that the health benefits of physical activity far
		  outweigh the risks of adverse events for almost everyone.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Building strong, healthy bones is also important for children and
		adolescents. Along with having a healthy diet that includes adequate calcium
		and vitamin D, physical activity is critical for bone development in children
		and adolescents. Bone-strengthening physical activity done 3 or more days a
		week increases bone-mineral content and bone density in youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular physical activity also helps people with arthritis or other
		rheumatic conditions affecting the joints. Participation in 130 to 150 minutes
		(2 hours and 10 minutes to 2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of
		moderate-intensity, low-impact physical activity improves pain management,
		function, and quality of life. Researchers don't yet know whether participation
		in physical activity, particularly at low to moderate intensity, reduces the
		risk of osteoarthritis. Very high levels of physical activity, however, may
		have extra risks. People who participate in very high levels of physical
		activity, such as elite or professional athletes, have a higher risk of hip and
		knee osteoarthritis, mostly due to the risk of injury involved in competing in
		some sports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Progressive muscle-strengthening activities increase or preserve muscle
		mass, strength, and power. Higher amounts (through greater frequency or higher
		weights) improve muscle function to a greater degree. Improvements occur in
		younger and older adults. Resistance exercises also improve muscular strength
		in persons with such conditions as stroke, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy,
		spinal cord injury, and cognitive disability. Though it doesn't increase muscle
		mass in the same way that muscle-strengthening activities do, aerobic activity
		may also help slow the loss of muscle with aging.
          </p>
          <h4>Functional Ability and Fall Prevention</h4>
          <p>
            Functional ability is the capacity of a person to perform tasks or
		behaviors that enable him or her to carry out everyday activities, such as
		climbing stairs or walking on a sidewalk. Functional ability is key to a
		person's ability to fulfill basic life roles, such as personal care, grocery
		shopping, or playing with the grandchildren. Loss of functional ability is
		referred to as functional limitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Middle-aged and older adults who are physically active have lower risk
		of functional limitations than do inactive adults. It appears that greater
		physical activity levels can further reduce risk of functional limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older adults who already have functional limitations also benefit from
		regular physical activity. Typically, studies of physical activity in adults
		with functional limitations tested a combination of aerobic and muscle
		strengthening activities, making it difficult to assess the relative importance
		of each type of activity. However, both types of activity appear to provide
		benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            In older adults at risk of falls, strong evidence shows that regular
		physical activity is safe and reduces this risk. Reduction in falls is seen for
		participants in programs that include balance and moderate-intensity
		muscle-strengthening activities for 90 minutes a week plus moderate-intensity
		walking for about an hour a week. It's not known whether different combinations
		of type, amount, or frequency of activity can reduce falls to a greater degree.
		Tai chi exercises also may help prevent falls.
          </p>
          <h4>Cancer</h4>
          <p>
            Physically active people have a significantly lower risk of colon
		cancer than do inactive people, and physically active women have a
		significantly lower risk of breast cancer. Research shows that a wide range of
		moderate-intensity physical activity—between 210 and 420 minutes a week (3
		hours and 30 minutes to 7 hours)—is needed to significantly reduce the
		risk of colon and breast cancer; currently, 150 minutes a week does not appear
		to provide a major benefit. It also appears that greater amounts of physical
		activity lower risks of these cancers even further, although exactly how much
		lower is not clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although not definitive, some research suggests that the risk of
		endometrial cancer in women and lung cancers in men and women also may be lower
		among those who are regularly active compared to those who are inactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, cancer survivors have a better quality of life and improved
		physical fitness if they are physically active, compared to survivors who are
		inactive.
          </p>
          <h4>Mental Health</h4>
          <p>
            Physically active adults have lower risk of depression and cognitive
		decline (declines with aging in thinking, learning, and judgment skills).
		Physical activity also may improve the quality of sleep. Whether physical
		activity reduces distress or anxiety is currently unclear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental health benefits have been found in people who do aerobic or a
		combination of aerobic and muscle– strengthening activities 3 to 5 days a
		week for 30 to 60 minutes at a time. Some research has shown that even lower
		levels of physical activity also may provide some benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular physical activity appears to reduce symptoms of anxiety and
		depression for children and adolescents. Whether physical activity improves
		self-esteem is not clear.
          </p>
          <h4>Adverse Events</h4>
          <p>
            Some people hesitate to become active or increase their level of
		physical activity because they fear getting injured or having a heart attack.
		Studies of generally healthy people clearly show that moderate-intensity
		physical activity, such as brisk walking, has a low risk of such
		<strong>adverse events.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The risk of musculoskeletal injury increases with the total amount of
		physical activity. For example, a person who regularly runs 40 miles a week has
		a higher risk of injury than a person who runs 10 miles each week. However,
		people who are physically active may have fewer injuries from other causes,
		such as motor vehicle collisions or work-related injuries. Depending on the
		type and amount of activity that physically active people do, their overall
		injury rate may be lower than the overall injury rate for inactive people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participation in contact or collision sports, such as soccer or
		football, has a higher risk of injury than participation in non-contact
		physical activity, such as swimming or walking. However, when performing the
		same activity, people who are less fit are more likely to be injured than
		people who are fitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cardiac events, such as a heart attack or sudden death during physical
		activity, are rare. However, the risk of such cardiac events does increase when
		a person suddenly becomes much more active than usual. The greatest risk occurs
		when an adult who is usually inactive engages in vigorous-intensity activity
		(such as shoveling snow). People who are regularly physically active have the
		lowest risk of cardiac events both while being active and overall.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bottom line is that the health benefits of physical activity far
		outweigh the risks of adverse events for almost everyone.

          <p>
            Regular physical activity in children and adolescents promotes health
		and fitness. Compared to those who are inactive, physically active youth have
		higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness and stronger muscles. They also
		typically have lower body fatness. Their bones are stronger, and they may have
		reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youth who are regularly active also have a better chance of a healthy
		adulthood. Children and adolescents don't usually develop chronic
		diseases, such as heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or
		osteoporosis. However, risk factors for these diseases can begin to develop
		early in life. Regular physical activity makes it less likely that these risk
		factors will develop and more likely that children will remain healthy as
		adults.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youth can achieve substantial health benefits by doing moderate- and
		vigorous-intensity physical activity for periods of time that add up to 60
		minutes (1 hour) or more each day. This activity should include aerobic
		activity as well as age-appropriate muscle- and bone–strengthening
		activities. Although current science is not complete, it appears that, as with
		adults, the total amount of physical activity is more important for achieving
		health benefits than is any one component (frequency, intensity, or duration)
		or specific mix of activities (aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone
		strengthening). Even so, bone-strengthening activities remain especially
		important for children and young adolescents because the greatest gains in bone
		mass occur during the years just before and during puberty. In addition, the
		majority of peak bone mass is obtained by the end of adolescence.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter provides physical activity guidance for children and
		adolescents aged 6 to 17, and focuses on physical activity beyond baseline
		activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents and other adults who work with or care for youth should be
		familiar with the Guidelines in this chapter. These adults should be aware
		that, as children become adolescents, they typically reduce their physical
		activity. Adults play an important role in providing age-appropriate
		opportunities for physical activity. In doing so, they help lay an important
		foundation for life-long, health-promoting physical activity. Adults need to
		encourage active play in children and encourage sustained and structured
		activity as children grow older.
          </p>
          <p class="BoxText">
          </p>
          <h3>Key Guidelines for Children and Adolescents</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Children and adolescents should do 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of
			 physical activity daily. 
			 <ul>
         <li><strong>Aerobic</strong>: Most of the 60 or more minutes a day
				  should be either moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, and
				  should include vigorous-intensity physical activity at least 3 days a week.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Muscle-strengthening</strong>: As part of their 60 or
				  more minutes of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should
				  include muscle-strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days of the week.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Bone-strengthening</strong>: As part of their 60 or
				  more minutes of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should
				  include bone-strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days of the week.
         </li>
       </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It is important to encourage young people to participate in
			 physical activities that are appropriate for their age, that are enjoyable, and
			 that offer variety. </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Explaining the Guidelines</h3>
          <h4>Types of Activity</h4>
          <p>
            The Guidelines for children and adolescents focus on three types of
		activity: aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening. Each type has
		important health benefits.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Aerobic activities</strong> are those in which young people
		  rhythmically move their large muscles. Running, hopping, skipping, jumping
		  rope, swimming, dancing, and bicycling are all examples of aerobic activities.
		  Aerobic activities increase cardiorespiratory fitness. Children often do
		  activities in short bursts, which may not technically be aerobic activities.
		  However, this document will also use the term aerobic to refer to these brief
		  activities. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Muscle-strengthening activities</strong> make muscles do more
		  work than usual during activities of daily life. This is called
		  “overload,” and it strengthens the muscles. Muscle-strengthening
		  activities can be unstructured and part of play, such as playing on playground
		  equipment, climbing trees, and playing tug-of-war. Or these activities can be
		  structured, such as lifting weights or working with resistance bands. </li>
            <li><strong>Bone-strengthening activities</strong> produce a force on
		  the bones that promotes bone growth and strength. This force is commonly
		  produced by impact with the ground. Running, jumping rope, basketball, tennis,
		  and hopscotch are all examples of bone strengthening activities. As these
		  examples illustrate, bone-strengthening activities can also be aerobic and
		  muscle-strengthening. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>How Age Influences Physical Activity in Children and Adolescents</h4>
          <p>
            Children and adolescents should meet the Guidelines by doing activity
		that is appropriate for their age. Their natural patterns of movement differ
		from those of adults. For example, children are naturally active in an
		intermittent way, particularly when they do unstructured active play. During
		recess and in their free play and games, children use basic aerobic and
		bone-strengthening activities, such as running, hopping, skipping, and jumping,
		to develop movement patterns and skills. They alternate brief periods of
		moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity with brief periods of rest.
		Any episode of moderate- or vigorous–intensity physical activity, however
		brief, counts toward the Guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children also commonly increase muscle strength through unstructured
		activities that involve lifting or moving their body weight or working against
		resistance. Children don't usually do or need formal muscle-strengthening

              Regular physical activity in children and adolescents promotes a
		  healthy body weight and body composition.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            As children grow into adolescents, their patterns of physical activity
		change. They are able to play organized games and sports and are able to
		sustain longer periods of activity. But they still commonly do intermittent
		activity, and no period of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity is too
		short to count toward the Guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adolescents may meet the Guidelines by doing free play, structured
		programs, or both. Structured exercise programs can include aerobic activities,
		such as playing a sport, and muscle-strengthening activities, such as lifting
		weights, working with resistance bands, or using body weight for resistance
		(such as push-ups, pull-ups, and sit-ups). Muscle-strengthening activities
		count if they involve a moderate to high level of effort and work the major
		muscle groups of the body: legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and
		arms.
          </p>
          <h4>Levels of Intensity for Aerobic Activity</h4>
          <p>
            Children and adolescents can meet the Guidelines by doing a combination
		of moderate- and vigorous intensity aerobic physical activities or by doing
		only vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youth should not do only moderate-intensity activity. It's
		important to include vigorous-intensity activities because they cause more
		improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intensity of aerobic physical activity can be defined on either an
		absolute or a relative scale. Either scale can be used to monitor the intensity
		of aerobic physical activity:
          </p>

            <h4>For More Information</h4>
            <p>
              See <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/appendix1.aspx" rel="nofollow" name="rdb-footnote-link-5" class="rdb-footnoted">Appendix 1</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-5">5</a></sup> for more information on using absolute or relative
		  intensity.
            </p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute intensity</strong> is based on the rate of energy
		  expenditure during the activity, without taking into account a person's
		  cardiorespiratory fitness. </li>
            <li><strong>Relative intensity</strong> uses a person's level of
		  cardiorespiratory fitness to assess level of effort. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Relative intensity describes a person's level of effort relative
		to his or her fitness. As a rule of thumb, on a scale of 0 to 10, where sitting
		is 0 and the highest level of effort possible is 10, moderate-intensity
		activity is a 5 or 6. Young people doing moderate-intensity activity will
		notice that their hearts are beating faster than normal and they are breathing
		harder than normal. Vigorous-intensity activity is at a level of 7 or 8. Youth
		doing vigorous-intensity activity will feel their heart beating much faster
		than normal and they will breathe much harder than normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            When adults supervise children, they generally can't ascertain a
		child's heart or breathing rate. But they can observe whether a child is
		doing an activity which, based on absolute energy expenditure, is considered to
		be either moderate or vigorous. For example, a child walking briskly to school
		is doing moderate-intensity activity. A child running on the playground is
		doing vigorous-intensity activity. The table on page 18 includes examples of
		activities classified by absolute intensity. It shows that the same activity
		can be moderate or vigorous intensity, depending on factors such as speed (for
		example bicycling slowly or fast).

            <em>Note</em>: Some activities, such as bicycling, can be
		moderate or vigorous intensity, depending upon level of effort
          </p>
          <h4>Physical Activity and Healthy Weight</h4>
          <p>
            Regular physical activity in children and adolescents promotes a
		healthy body weight and body composition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exercise training in overweight or obese youth can improve body
		composition by reducing overall levels of fatness as well as abdominal fatness.
		Research studies report that fatness can be reduced by regular physical
		activity of moderate to vigorous intensity 3 to 5 times a week, for 30 to 60
		minutes.
          </p>
          <h3>Meeting the Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            American youth vary in their physical activity participation. Some
		don't participate at all, others participate in enough activity to meet
		the Guidelines, and some exceed the Guidelines.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              Children and adolescents can meet the Physical Activity Guidelines and
		  become regularly physically active in many ways.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            One practical strategy to promote activity in youth is to replace
		inactivity with activity whenever possible. For example, where appropriate and
		safe, young people should walk or bicycle to school instead of riding in a car.
		Rather than just watching sporting events on television, young people should
		participate in age-appropriate sports or games.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Children and adolescents who do not meet the
		  Guidelines</strong> should slowly increase their activity in small steps and in
		  ways that they enjoy. A gradual increase in the number of days and the time
		  spent being active will help reduce the risk of injury. </li>
            <li><strong>Children and adolescents who meet the Guidelines</strong>
              should continue being active on a daily basis and, if appropriate, become even
		  more active. Evidence suggests that even more than 60 minutes of activity every
		  day may provide additional health benefits. </li>
            <li><strong>Children and adolescents who exceed the Guidelines</strong>
              should maintain their activity level and vary the kinds of activities they do
		  to reduce the risk of overtraining or injury. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Children and adolescents with disabilities are more likely to be
		inactive than those without disabilities. Youth with disabilities should work
		with their health-care provider to understand the types and amounts of physical
		activity appropriate for them. When possible, children and adolescents with
		disabilities should meet the Guidelines. When young people are not able to
		participate in appropriate physical activities to meet the Guidelines, they
		should be as active as possible and avoid being inactive.
          </p>
          <h3>Getting and Staying Active: Real-Life Examples</h3>
          <p>
            Children and adolescents can meet the Physical Activity Guidelines and
		become regularly physically active in many ways. Here are just two examples
		showing how a child and an adolescent can be physically active for at least 60
		minutes each day over the course of a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            These examples illustrate that even though the activity patterns are
		different, each young person is meeting the Guidelines by getting the
		equivalent of at least 60 minutes or more of aerobic activity each day that is
		at least moderate intensity. Both are also doing vigorous-intensity,
		muscle-strengthening, and bone strengthening activities on at least 3 days a
		week.

		gymnastics and sit-ups. During recess, he plays on the playground—often by
		doing activities that require running and climbing. He also likes to play
		soccer with his friends and family. When Harold gets home from school, he likes

            Adults who are physically active are healthier and less likely to
		develop many chronic diseases than adults who are inactive. They also have
		better fitness, including a healthier body size and composition. These benefits
		are gained by men and women and people of all races and ethnicities who have
		been studied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adults gain most of these health benefits when they do the equivalent
		of at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity (2
		hours and 30 minutes) each week. Adults gain additional and more extensive
		health and fitness benefits with even more physical activity.
		Muscle-strengthening activities also provide health benefits and are an
		important part of an adult's overall physical activity plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter provides guidance for most men and women aged 18 to 64
		years, and focuses on physical activity beyond baseline activity (the usual
		light or sedentary activities of daily living). Physical activity guidelines
		for women during pregnancy and the postpartum period and for adults with
		disabilities and select chronic conditions are discussed in <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter7.aspx" rel="nofollow" name="rdb-footnote-link-10" class="rdb-footnoted">Chapter
		7—Additional Considerations for Some Adults</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-10">10</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <h3>Explaining the Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            The Guidelines for adults focus on two types of activity: aerobic and
		muscle-strengthening. Each type provides important health benefits, as
		explained in <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter2.aspx" rel="nofollow" name="rdb-footnote-link-11" class="rdb-footnoted">Chapter 2—Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-11">11</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <h4>Aerobic Activity</h4>
          <p>
            Aerobic activities, also called endurance activities, are physical
		activities in which people move their large muscles in a rhythmic manner for a
		sustained period. Running, brisk walking, bicycling, playing basketball,
		dancing, and swimming are all examples of aerobic activities. Aerobic activity
		makes a person's heart beat more rapidly to meet the demands of the
		body's movement. Over time, regular aerobic activity makes the heart and
		cardiovascular system stronger and fitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the aerobic activity does not affect whether it counts
		toward meeting the Guidelines. For example, physically active occupations can
		count toward meeting the Guidelines, as can active transportation choices
		(walking or bicycling). All types of aerobic activities can count as long as
		they are of sufficient intensity and duration. Time spent in muscle
		strengthening activities does not count toward the aerobic activity guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            When putting the Guidelines into action, it's important to
		consider the total amount of activity, as well as how often to be active, for
		how long, and at what intensity.
          </p>
          <p class="BoxText">
          </p>
          <h3>Key Guidelines for Adults</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>All adults should avoid inactivity. Some physical activity is
			 better than none, and adults who participate in any amount of physical activity
			 gain some health benefits. </li>
            <li>For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150
			 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1
			 hour and 15 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or
			 an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.
			 Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and
			 preferably, it should be spread throughout the week. </li>
            <li>For additional and more extensive health benefits, adults should
			 increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of
			 moderate-intensity, or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic
			 physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and
			 vigorous-intensity activity. Additional health benefits are gained by engaging
			 in physical activity beyond this amount. </li>
            <li>Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are
			 moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more
			 days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits. </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <strong>How Much Total Activity a Week?</strong><br>
            When adults do the
		equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, the
		benefits are <em>substantial</em>. These benefits include lower risk of
		premature death, coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
		and depression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all health benefits of physical activity occur at 150 minutes a
		week. As a person moves from 150 minutes a week toward 300 minutes (5 hours) a
		week, he or she gains <em>additional</em> health benefits. Additional benefits
		include lower risk of colon and breast cancer and prevention of unhealthy
		weight gain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, as a person moves from 150 minutes a week toward 300 minutes a
		week, the benefits that occur at 150 minutes a week become <em>more
		extensive</em>. For example, a person who does 300 minutes a week has an even
		lower risk of heart disease or diabetes than a person who does 150 minutes a
		week.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefits continue to increase when a person does more than the
		equivalent of 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. For
		example, a person who does 420 minutes (7 hours) a week has an even lower risk
		of premature death than a person who does 150 to 300 minutes a week. Current
		science does not allow identifying an upper limit of total activity above which
		there are no additional health benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How Many Days a Week and for How Long?</strong><br>
            Aerobic
		physical activity should preferably be spread throughout the week. Research
		studies consistently show that activity performed on at least 3 days a week
		produces health benefits. Spreading physical activity across at least 3 days a
		week may help to reduce the risk of injury and avoid excessive fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity should be
		performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes. Episodes of this duration are
		known to improve cardiovascular fitness and some risk factors for heart disease
		and type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How Intense?</strong><br>
            The Guidelines for adults focus on two
		levels of intensity: moderate-intensity activity and vigorous–intensity
		activity. To meet the Guidelines, adults can do either moderate-intensity or
		vigorous-intensity aerobic activities, or a combination of both. It takes less
		time to get the same benefit from vigorous-intensity activities as from
		moderate-intensity activities. A general rule of thumb is that 2 minutes of
		moderate-intensity activity counts the same as 1 minute of vigorous-intensity
		activity. For example, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week is
		roughly the same as 15 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two ways to track the intensity of aerobic activity: absolute
		intensity and relative intensity.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute intensity</strong> is the amount of energy expended
		  per minute of activity. The energy expenditure of light-intensity activity, for
		  example, is 1.1 to 2.9 times the amount of energy expended when a person is at
		  rest. Moderate-intensity activities expend 3.0 to 5.9 times the amount of
		  energy expended at rest. The energy expenditure of vigorous-intensity
		  activities is 6.0 or more times the energy expended at rest. </li>
            <li><strong>Relative intensity</strong> is the level of effort required
		  to do an activity. Less fit people generally require a higher level of effort
		  than fitter people to do the same activity. Relative intensity can be estimated
		  using a scale of 0 to 10, where sitting is 0 and the highest level of effort
		  possible is 10. Moderate intensity activity is a 5 or 6. Vigorous-intensity
		  activity is a 7 or 8. </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="Pull">
            <h4>For More Information</h4>
            <p>
              See <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/appendix1.aspx" rel="nofollow" name="rdb-footnote-link-12" class="rdb-footnoted">Appendix 1</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-12">12</a></sup> for more information on using absolute or relative
		  intensity
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The Guidelines for adults refer to absolute intensity because most
		studies demonstrating lower risks of clinical events (for example, premature
		death, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer) have focused on
		measuring absolute intensity. That is, the Guidelines are based on the absolute
		amount of energy expended in physical activity that is associated with health
		benefits. The table lists some examples of activities classified as
		moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity based on absolute intensity. Either
		absolute or relative intensity can be used to monitor progress in meeting the
		Guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            When using relative intensity, people pay attention to how physical
		activity affects their heart rate and breathing. As a rule of thumb, a person
		doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity can talk, but not sing, during the
		activity. A person doing vigorous intensity activity cannot say more than a few
		words without pausing for a breath.

            <em>Note</em>: This table provides several examples of
		activities classified as moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity, based on
		absolute intensity. This list is not all-inclusive. Instead, the examples are
		meant to help people make choices.
          </p>
          <h4>Muscle-Strengthening Activity</h4>
          <p>
            Muscle-strengthening activities provide additional benefits not found
		with aerobic activity. The benefits of muscle-strengthening activity include
		increased bone strength and muscular fitness. Muscle-strengthening activities
		can also help maintain muscle mass during a program of weight loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Muscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work than they are
		accustomed to doing. That is, they overload the muscles. Resistance training,
		including weight training, is a familiar example of muscle-strengthening
		activity. Other examples include working with resistance bands, doing
		calisthenics that use body weight for resistance (such as push-ups, pull-ups,
		and sit-ups), carrying heavy loads, and heavy gardening (such as digging or
		hoeing).
          </p>
          <p>
            Muscle-strengthening activities count if they involve a moderate to
		high level of intensity or effort and work the major muscle groups of the body:
		the legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. muscle strengthening
		activities for all the major muscle groups should be done at least 2 days a
		week.
          </p>
          <p>
            No specific amount of time is recommended for muscle strengthening, but
		muscle-strengthening exercises should be performed to the point at which it
		would be difficult to do another repetition without help. When resistance
		training is used to enhance muscle strength, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of
		each exercise is effective, although two or three sets may be more effective.
		Development of muscle strength and endurance is progressive over time.
		Increases in the amount of weight or the days a week of exercising will result
		in stronger muscles.
          </p>
          <h3>Meeting the Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            Adults have many options for becoming physically active, increasing
		their physical activity, and staying active throughout their lives. In deciding
		how to meet the Guidelines, adults should think about how much physical
		activity they're already doing and how physically fit they are. Personal
		health and fitness goals are also important to consider. Examples provided
		later in the chapter illustrate how to include these goals in decisions to be
		active.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, healthy men and women who plan prudent increases in their
		weekly amounts of physical activity do not need to consult a health-care
		provider before becoming active.
          </p>
          <h4>Inactive Adults</h4>
          <p>
            Inactive adults or those who don't yet do 150 minutes of physical
		activity a week should work gradually toward this goal. The initial amount of
		activity should be at a light or moderate intensity, for short periods of time,
		with the sessions spread throughout the week. The good news is that “some
		is better than none.”
          </p>
          <p>
            People gain some health benefits even when they do as little as 60
		minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            To reduce risk of injury, it is important to increase the amount of
		physical activity gradually over a period of weeks to months. For example, an
		inactive person could start with a walking program consisting of 5 minutes of
		slow walking several times each day, 5 to 6 days a week. The length of time
		could then gradually be increased to 10 minutes per session, 3 times a day, and
		the walking speed could be increased slowly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Muscle-strengthening activities should also be gradually increased over
		time. Initially, these activities can be done just 1 day a week starting at a
		light or moderate level of effort. Over time, the number of days a week can be
		increased to 2, and then possibly to more than 2. Each week, the level of
		effort (intensity) can be increased slightly until it becomes moderate to high.
          </p>
          <h4>Active Adults</h4>
          <p>
            Adults who are already active and meet the minimum Guidelines (the
		equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week)
		can gain additional and more extensive health and fitness benefits by
		increasing physical activity above this amount. Most American adults should
		increase their aerobic activity to exceed the minimum level and move toward 300
		minutes a week. Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities on at
		least 2 days each week.
          </p>
          <p>
            One time-efficient way to achieve greater fitness and health goals is
		to substitute vigorous-intensity aerobic activity for some moderate-intensity
		activity. Using the 2-to-1 rule of thumb, doing 150 minutes of
		vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week provides about the same benefits as
		300 minutes of moderate intensity activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adults are encouraged to do a variety of activities, as variety
		probably reduces risk of injury caused by doing too much of one kind of
		activity (this is called an overuse injury).
          </p>
          <h4>Highly Active Adults</h4>
          <p>
            Adults who are highly active should maintain their activity level.
		These adults are also encouraged to do a variety of activities.
          </p>
          <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
          <h4>Flexibility Activities</h4>
          <p>
            Flexibility is an important part of physical fitness. Some types of
		physical activity, such as dancing, require more flexibility than others.
		Stretching exercises are effective in increasing flexibility, and thereby can
		allow people to more easily do activities that require greater flexibility. For
		this reason, flexibility activities are an appropriate part of a physical
		activity program, even though they have no known health benefits and it is
		unclear whether they reduce risk of injury. Time spent doing flexibility
		activities by themselves does not count toward meeting the aerobic or
		muscle-strengthening Guidelines.
          </p>
          <h4>Warm-up and Cool-down</h4>
          <p>
            Warm-up and cool-down activities are an acceptable part of a
		person's physical activity plan. Commonly, the warm-up and cool-down
		involve doing an activity at a slower speed or lower intensity. A warm-up
		before moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity allows a gradual
		increase in heart rate and breathing at the start of the episode of activity. A
		cool-down after activity allows a gradual decrease at the end of the episode.
		Time spent doing warm-up and cool-down may count toward meeting the aerobic
		activity Guidelines if the activity is at least moderate intensity (for
		example, walking briskly as a warm-up before jogging). A warm-up for
		muscle-strengthening activity commonly involves doing exercises with lighter
		weight.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull">
            <h4>For More Information</h4>
            <p>
              See the <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> for additional
		  information on weight management and how to determine a healthy weight.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Physical Activity in a Weight-Control Plan</h4>
          <p>
            Along with appropriate dietary intake, physical activity is an
		important part of maintaining healthy weight, losing weight, and keeping extra
		weight off once it has been lost. Physical activity also helps reduce abdominal
		fat and preserve muscle during weight loss. Adults should aim for a healthy,
		stable body weight. The amount of physical activity necessary to achieve this
		weight varies greatly from person to person.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step in achieving or maintaining a healthy weight is to meet
		the minimum level of physical activity in the Guidelines. For some people this
		will result in a stable and healthy body weight, but for many it may not.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              The health benefits of physical activity are generally independent of
		  body weight. The good news for people needing to lose weight is that regular
		  physical activity provides major health benefits, no matter how their weight
		  changes over time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              Adults should strongly consider walking as one good way to get aerobic
		  physical activity. Many studies show that walking has health benefits and a low
		  risk of injury. It can be done year-round and in many settings.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            People who are at a healthy body weight but slowly gaining weight can
		either gradually increase the level of physical activity (toward the equivalent
		of 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity), or reduce
		caloric intake, or both, until their weight is stable. By regularly checking
		body weight, people can find the amount of physical activity that works for
		them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many adults will need to do more than the 150 minutes a week of
		moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity as part of a program to lose
		weight or keep it off. These adults should do more physical activity and/or
		further reduce their caloric intake. Some people will need to do the equivalent
		of 300 or more minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week to meet
		their weight-control goals. Combined with restricting caloric intake, these
		adults should gradually increase minutes or the intensity of aerobic physical
		activity per week, to the point at which the physical activity is effective in
		achieving a healthy weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to remember that all activities—both baseline and
		physical activity—“count” for energy balance. Active choices,
		such as taking the stairs rather than the elevator or adding short episodes of
		walking to the day, are examples of activities that can be helpful in weight
		control.
          </p>
          <p>
            For weight control, vigorous-intensity activity is far more
		time-efficient than moderate-intensity activity. For example, an adult who
		weighs 165 pounds (75 kg) will burn 560 calories from 150 minutes of brisk
		walking at 4 miles an hour (these calories are in addition to the calories
		normally burned by a body at rest). That person can burn the same number of
		additional calories in 50 minutes by running 5 miles at a 10 minutes-per-mile
		pace.
          </p>
          <h3>Getting and Staying Active: Real-Life Examples</h3>
          <p>
            Adults can meet the <em>Physical Activity Guidelines</em> in all sorts
		of ways and with many types of physical activity. The choices of types and
		amounts of physical activity depend on personal health and fitness goals. Here
		are three examples.
          </p>
          <h4>Jean: An Inactive Middle-Aged Woman</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Her goals</strong>: Jean sets a goal of doing 1 hour a day of
		moderate-intensity aerobic activity on 5 days a week (a total of 300 minutes a
		week). Weighing 220 pounds, Jean is obese and wants to lose about 1 pound of
		weight each week.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Starting out</strong>: Jean cuts back on her caloric intake and
		starts walking 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the evening most days
		of the week. She walks at a 2.5 mile-an-hour pace. Although physical activity
		tables show this to be light-intensity activity, for her level of fitness and
		fatness, it is appropriate moderate–intensity activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Making good progress</strong>: Two months later, Jean is
		comfortably walking 30 to 40 minutes at moderate intensity to and from her bus
		stop every day. She then adds variety to her activity by alternating among
		walking, riding a stationary cycle, and low-impact aerobics. She also begins
		muscle-strengthening activities, using elastic bands twice each week.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              Adults can meet the<em> Physical Activity Guidelines</em> in all sorts
		  of ways and with many types of physical activity.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>Reaching her goal</strong>: Eventually, Jean works up to 300
		minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, including her brisk
		walks to and from the bus stop. She has lost 40 pounds of weight in 1 year,
		with most of the weight loss occurring the previous 6 months when she mastered
		her diet and was able to do greater amounts of physical activity.
          </p>
          <h4>Douglas: An Active Middle-Aged Man</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>His goal and current activity pattern</strong>: Douglas was a
		soccer player in his youth. His goal is to get back into shape by becoming a
		regular recreational runner. In addition to his job operating heavy equipment,
		he walks 30 to 40 minutes a day on 5 days each week. He also lifts weights 2
		days a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Starting out:</strong> Douglas starts a walk/jog program with
		a co-worker and plans to gradually replace walking with jogging and then
		running. The first week he goes out on 5 days, walking for 25 minutes and
		jogging for 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Making good progress</strong>: Each week, Douglas gradually
		increases the time spent jogging (vigorous-intensity activity) and reduces the
		time spent walking (moderate–intensity activity). He also continues his
		weight-lifting program.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reaching his goal</strong>: Eventually, Douglas is running 30
		to 45 minutes 4 days a week and lifting weights 2 days a week. He goes for a
		1-hour bicycle ride on most weekends.
          </p>
          <h4>Anita: A Very Active College-Aged Adult</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Her goals and current activity pattern</strong>: Anita plays
		league basketball (vigorous-intensity activity) 4 days each week for 90 minutes
		each day. She wants to reduce her risk of injury from doing too much of one
		kind of activity (this is called an overuse injury).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Starting out</strong>: Anita starts out by cutting back her
		basketball playing to 3 days each week. She begins to bicycle to and from
		campus (30 minutes each way) instead of driving her car. She also joins a yoga
		class that meets twice each week.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reaching her goal</strong>: Eventually, Anita is bicycling 3
		days each week to and from campus in addition to playing basketball. Her yoga
		class helps her to build and maintain strength and flexibility.

            <h3>
              Achieving Target Levels of Physical Activity: The Possibilities Are
		  Endless
            </h3>
            <p>
              These examples show how it's possible to meet the Guidelines by
		  doing moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity activity or a combination of
		  both. Physical activity at this level provides substantial health benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ways to get the equivalent of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of
		  moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity a week plus muscle-strengthening
		  activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Thirty minutes of brisk walking (moderate intensity) on 5 days,
			 exercising with resistance bands (muscle strengthening) on 2 days; </li>
              <li>Twenty-five minutes of running (vigorous intensity) on 3 days,
			 lifting weights on 2 days (muscle strengthening); </li>
              <li>Thirty minutes of brisk walking on 2 days, 60 minutes (1 hour) of
			 social dancing (moderate intensity) on 1 evening, 30 minutes of mowing the lawn
			 (moderate intensity) on 1 afternoon, heavy gardening (muscle strengthening) on
			 2 days; </li>
              <li>Thirty minutes of an aerobic dance class on 1 morning (vigorous
			 intensity), 30 minutes of running on 1 day (vigorous intensity), 30 minutes of
			 brisk walking on 1 day (moderate intensity), calisthenics (such as sit-ups,
			 push-ups) on 3 days (muscle strengthening); </li>
              <li>Thirty minutes of biking to and from work on 3 days (moderate
			 intensity), playing softball for 60 minutes on 1 day (moderate intensity),
			 using weight machines on 2 days (muscle-strengthening on 2 days); and </li>
              <li>Forty-five minutes of doubles tennis on 2 days (moderate
			 intensity), lifting weights after work on 1 day (muscle strengthening), hiking
			 vigorously for 30 minutes and rock climbing (muscle strengthening) on 1 day.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ways to be even more active</h4>
            <p>
              For adults who are already doing at least 150 minutes of
		  moderate-intensity physical activity, here are a few ways to do even more.
		  Physical activity at this level has even greater health benefits.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Forty-five minutes of brisk walking every day, exercising with
			 resistance bands on 2 or 3 days; </li>

			 training in a gym on 2 or 3 days; </li>
              <li>Thirty minutes of running on 2 days, 45 minutes of brisk walking
			 on 1 day, 45 minutes of an aerobics and weights class on 1 day, 90 minutes (1
			 hour and 30 minutes) of social dancing on 1 evening, 30 minutes of mowing the
			 lawn, plus some heavy garden work on 1 day; </li>
              <li>Ninety minutes of playing soccer on 1 day, brisk walking for 15
			 minutes on 3 days, lifting weights on 2 days; and </li>
              <li>Forty-five minutes of stationary bicycling on 2 days, 60 minutes

          <p>
            Regular physical activity is essential for healthy aging. Adults aged
		65 years and older gain substantial health benefits from regular physical
		activity, and these benefits continue to occur throughout their lives.
		Promoting physical activity for older adults is especially important because
		this population is the least physically active of any age group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older adults are a varied group. Most, but not all, have one or more
		chronic conditions, and these conditions vary in type and severity. All have
		experienced a loss of physical fitness with age, some more than others. This
		diversity means that some older adults can run several miles, while others
		struggle to walk several blocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter provides guidance about physical activity for adults aged
		65 years and older. The chapter focuses on physical activity beyond baseline
		activity. The Guidelines seek to help older adults select types and amounts of
		physical activity appropriate for their abilities. The Guidelines for older
		adults are also appropriate for adults younger than age 65 who have chronic
		conditions and those with a low level of fitness.
          </p>
          <p>
            For adults aged 65 and older who are fit and have no limiting chronic
		conditions, the guidance in this chapter is essentially the same as that
		provided in <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter4.aspx" name="rdb-footnote-link-17" class="rdb-footnoted">Chapter 4—Active Adults</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-17">17</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <h3>Explaining the Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            Like the Guidelines for other adults, those for older adults mainly
		focus on two types of activity: aerobic and muscle-strengthening. In addition,
		these Guidelines discuss the addition of <strong>balance training</strong> for
		older adults at risk of falls. Each type provides important health benefits, as
		explained in <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter2.aspx" name="rdb-footnote-link-18" class="rdb-footnoted">Chapter 2—Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-18">18</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <h4>Aerobic Activity</h4>
          <p>
            People doing aerobic activities move large muscles in a rhythmic manner
		for a sustained period. Brisk walking, jogging, biking, dancing, and swimming
		are all examples of aerobic activities. This type of activity is also called
		endurance activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aerobic activity makes a person's heart beat more rapidly to meet
		the demands of the body's movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, regular aerobic activity makes the heart and cardiovascular
		system stronger and fitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            When putting the Guidelines into action, it's important to
		consider the total amount of activity, as well as how often to be active, for
		how long, and at what intensity.
          </p>
          <div class="BoxText">
            <h3>Key Guidelines for Older Adults</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The following Guidelines are the same for adults and older
		  adults:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>All older adults should avoid inactivity. Some physical activity is
			 better than none, and older adults who participate in any amount of physical
			 activity gain some health benefits. </li>
              <li>For substantial health benefits, older adults should do at least
			 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75
			 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical
			 activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity
			 aerobic activity. Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least
			 10 minutes, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week. </li>
              <li>For additional and more extensive health benefits, older adults
			 should increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week
			 of moderate-intensity, or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic
			 physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and
			 vigorous-intensity activity. Additional health benefits are gained by engaging
			 in physical activity beyond this amount. </li>
              <li>Older adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that
			 are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more
			 days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>The following Guidelines are just for older
		  adults:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When older adults cannot do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
			 aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions, they should be as
			 physically active as their abilities and conditions allow. </li>
              <li>Older adults should do exercises that maintain or improve balance
			 if they are at risk of falling. </li>
              <li>Older adults should determine their level of effort for physical
			 activity relative to their level of fitness. </li>
              <li>Older adults with chronic conditions should understand whether and
			 how their conditions affect their ability to do regular physical activity
			 safely. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>How much total activity a week?</strong><br>
            Older adults should
		aim to do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity
		physical activity a week, or an equivalent amount (75 minutes or 1 hour and 15
		minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity. Older adults can also do an equivalent
		amount of activity by combining moderate- and vigorous–intensity
		activity. As is true for younger people, greater amounts of physical activity
		provide additional and more extensive health benefits to people aged 65 years
		and older.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter what its purpose—walking the dog, taking a dance or
		exercise class, or bicycling to the store—aerobic activity of all types
		counts toward the Guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How many days a week and for how long?</strong><br>
            Aerobic
		physical activity should be spread throughout the week. Research studies
		consistently show that activity performed on at least 3 days a week produces
		health benefits. Spreading physical activity across at least 3 days a week may
		help to reduce the risk of injury and avoid excessive fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Episodes of aerobic activity count toward meeting the Guidelines if
		they last at least 10 minutes and are performed at moderate or vigorous
		intensity. These episodes can be divided throughout the day or week. For
		example, a person who takes a brisk 15-minute walk twice a day on every day of
		the week would easily meet the minimum Guideline for aerobic activity.
          </p>

            Examples of Aerobic and Muscle-Strengthening Physical Activities for

          </table>
          <p>
            <strong>How intense?</strong><br>
            Older adults can meet the Guidelines
		by doing relatively moderate-intensity activity, relatively
		vigorous–intensity activity, or a combination of both. Time spent in
		light activity (such as light housework) and sedentary activities (such as
		watching TV) do not count.
          </p>
          <p>
            The relative intensity of aerobic activity is related to a
		person's level of cardiorespiratory fitness.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Moderate-intensity activity</strong> requires a medium level
		  of effort. On a scale of 0 to 10, where sitting is 0 and the greatest effort
		  possible is 10, moderate-intensity activity is a 5 or 6 and produces noticeable
		  increases in breathing rate and heart rate. </li>
            <li><strong>Vigorous-intensity activity</strong> is a 7 or 8 on this
		  scale and produces large increases in a person's breathing and heart rate.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A general rule of thumb is that 2 minutes of moderate–intensity
		activity count the same as 1 minute of vigorous-intensity activity. For
		example, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week is roughly same as 15
		minutes of vigorous-intensity activity.
          </p>
          <h4>Muscle-Strengthening Activities</h4>
          <p>
            At least 2 days a week, older adults should do
		muscle–strengthening activities that involve all the major muscle groups.
		These are the muscles of the legs, hips, chest, back, abdomen, shoulders, and
		arms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Muscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work than they are
		accustomed to during activities of daily life. Examples of muscle-strengthening
		activities include lifting weights, working with resistance bands, doing
		calisthenics using body weight for resistance (such as push-ups, pull-ups, and
		sit-ups), climbing stairs, carrying heavy loads, and heavy gardening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Muscle-strengthening activities count if they involve a moderate to
		high level of intensity, or effort, and work the major muscle groups of the
		body. Whatever the reason for doing it, any muscle-strengthening activity
		counts toward meeting the Guidelines. For example, muscle-strengthening
		activity done as part of a therapy or rehabilitation program can count.
          </p>
          <p>
            No specific amount of time is recommended for muscle strengthening, but
		muscle-strengthening exercises should be performed to the point at which it
		would be difficult to do another repetition without help. When resistance
		training is used to enhance muscle strength, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of
		each exercise is effective, although two or three sets may be more effective.
		Development of muscle strength and endurance is progressive over time. This
		means that gradual increases in the amount of weight or the days per week of
		exercise will result in stronger muscles.
          </p>
          <h4>Balance Activities for Older Adults at Risk of Falls</h4>
          <p>
            Older adults are at increased risk of falls if they have had falls in
		the recent past or have trouble walking. In older adults at increased risk of
		falls, strong evidence shows that regular physical activity is safe and reduces
		the risk of falls. Reduction in falls is seen for participants in programs that
		include balance and moderate-intensity muscle-strengthening activities for 90
		minutes (1 hour and 30 minutes) a week plus moderate-intensity walking for
		about 1 hour a week. Preferably, older adults at risk of falls should do
		balance training 3 or more days a week and do standardized exercises from a
		program demonstrated to reduce falls. Examples of these exercises include
		backward walking, sideways walking, heel walking, toe walking, and standing
		from a sitting position. The exercises can increase in difficulty by
		progressing from holding onto a stable support (like furniture) while doing the
		exercises to doing them without support. It's not known whether different
		combinations of type, amount, or frequency of activity can reduce falls to a
		greater degree. Tai chi exercises also may help prevent falls.
          </p>
          <h3>Meeting the Guidelines</h3>

          <p>
            Older adults have many ways to live an active lifestyle that meets the
		Guidelines. Many factors influence decisions to be active, such as personal
		goals, current physical activity habits, and health and safety considerations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Healthy older adults generally do not need to consult a health-care
		provider before becoming physically active. However, health-care providers can
		help people attain and maintain regular physical activity by providing advice
		on appropriate types of activities and ways to progress at a safe and steady
		pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adults with chronic conditions should talk with their health-care
		provider to determine whether their conditions limit their ability to do
		regular physical activity in any way. Such a conversation should also help
		people learn about appropriate types and amounts of physical activity.
          </p>
          <h4>Inactive Older Adults</h4>
          <p>
            Older adults should increase their amount of physical activity
		gradually. It can take months for those with a low level of fitness to
		gradually meet their activity goals. To reduce injury risk, inactive or
		insufficiently active adults should avoid vigorous aerobic activity at first.
		Rather, they should gradually increase the number of days a week and duration
		of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Adults with a very low level of fitness
		can start out with episodes of activity less than 10 minutes and slowly
		increase the minutes of light-intensity aerobic activity, such as
		light-intensity walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older adults who are inactive or who don't yet meet the Guidelines
		should aim for at least 150 minutes a week of relatively moderate-intensity
		physical activity. Getting at least 30 minutes of relatively
		moderate–intensity physical activity on 5 or more days each week is a
		reasonable way to meet these Guidelines. Doing muscle-strengthening activity on
		2 or 3 nonconsecutive days each week is also an acceptable and appropriate goal
		for many older adults.
          </p>
          <h4>Active Older Adults</h4>
          <p>
            Older adults who are already active and meet the Guidelines can gain
		additional and more extensive health benefits by moving beyond the 150 minutes
		a week minimum to 300 or more minutes a week of relatively moderate-intensity
		aerobic activity. Muscle–strengthening activities should also be done at
		least 2 days a week.
          </p>
          <h4>Older Adults With Chronic Conditions</h4>

          <p>
            Older adults who have chronic conditions that prevent them from doing
		the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week
		should set physical activity goals that meet their abilities. They should talk
		with their health-care provider about setting physical activity goals. They
		should avoid an inactive lifestyle. Even 60 minutes (1 hour) a week of
		moderate-intensity aerobic activity provides some health benefits.
          </p>
          <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
          <h4>Doing a Variety of Activities, Including Walking</h4>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              Older adults have many ways to live an active lifestyle that meets the
		  Guidelines.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            In working toward meeting the Guidelines, older adults are encouraged
		to do a variety of activities. This approach can make activity more enjoyable
		and may reduce the risk of overuse injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older adults also should strongly consider walking as one good way to
		get aerobic activity. Many studies show that walking has health benefits, and
		it has a low risk of injury. It can be done year-round and in many settings.
          </p>
          <h4>Physical Activity for Older Adults Who Have Functional Limitations</h4>

          <p>
            When a person has lost some ability to do a task of everyday life, such
		as climbing stairs, the person has a functional limitation. In older adults
		with existing functional limitations, scientific evidence indicates that
		regular physical activity is safe and helps improve functional ability.
          </p>
          <h4>Resuming Activity After an Illness or Injury</h4>
          <p>
            Older adults may have to take a break from regular physical activity
		because of illness or injury, such as the flu or a muscle strain. If these
		interruptions occur, older adults should resume activity at a lower level and
		gradually work back up to their former level of activity.
          </p>
          <h4>Flexibility, Warm-up, and Cool-down</h4>
          <p>
            Older adults should maintain the flexibility necessary for regular
		physical activity and activities of daily life. When done properly, stretching
		activities increase flexibility. Although these activities alone have no known
		health benefits and have not been demonstrated to reduce risk of
		activity-related injuries, they are an appropriate component of a physical
		activity program. However, time spent doing flexibility activities by
		themselves does not count toward meeting aerobic or muscle-strengthening
		Guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research studies of effective exercise programs typically include
		warm-up and cool-down activities. Warm-up and cool-down activities before and
		after physical activity can also be included as part of a personal program. A
		warm-up before moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity allows a
		gradual increase in heart rate and breathing at the start of the episode of
		activity. A cool-down after activity allows a gradual decrease at the end of
		the episode. Time spent doing warm-up and cool-down may count toward meeting
		the aerobic activity Guidelines if the activity is at least moderate intensity
		(for example, walking briskly to warm-up for a jog). A warm-up for
		muscle-strengthening activity commonly involves doing exercises with less
		weight than during the strengthening activity.
          </p>
          <h4>Physical Activity in a Weight-Control Plan</h4>
          <p>
            The amount of physical activity necessary to successfully maintain a
		healthy body weight depends on caloric intake and varies considerably among
		older adults. To achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, older adults
		should first do the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic
		activity each week. If necessary, older adults should increase their weekly
		minutes of aerobic physical activity gradually over time and decrease caloric
		intake to a point where they can achieve energy balance and a healthy weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some older adults will need a higher level of physical activity than
		others to maintain a healthy body weight. Some may need more than the
		equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity activity. It
		is possible to achieve this level of activity by gradually increasing activity
		over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older adults who are capable of relatively vigorous–intensity
		activity and need a high level of physical activity to maintain a healthy
		weight should consider some relatively vigorous-intensity activity as a means
		of weight control. This approach is more time-efficient than doing only
		moderate-intensity activity. However, high levels of activity are not feasible
		for many older adults. These adults should achieve a level of physical activity
		that is sustainable and safe. If further weight loss is needed, these older
		adults should achieve energy balance by regulating caloric intake.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to remember that all activities "count" for
		energy balance. Active choices, such as taking the stairs rather than the
		elevator or adding short episodes of walking to the day, are examples of
		activities that can be helpful in weight control.
          </p>
          <h3>Getting and Staying Active: Real-Life Examples</h3>
          <p>
            The following examples show how different people with different living
		circumstances and levels of fitness can meet the Guidelines for older adults.
          </p>
          <h4>Mary: A 75-Year-Old Woman Living Independently in Her Own Home</h4>
          <p>
            Mary gets the equivalent of 180 minutes (3 hours) of moderate-intensity
		aerobic activity each week, plus muscle-strengthening activity 3 days a week.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>She participates regularly in an exercise class at her local senior
		  center. The class meets Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. It includes 30
		  minutes of aerobic dance, which she can do at moderate intensity, as well as 20
		  minutes of <strong>strength training</strong>, a 5-minute warm-up, a 5-minute
		  cool-down, and some stretching exercises. </li>
            <li>On most Sundays, she visits her favorite park and walks a loop trail
		  with several friends, which takes them about 45 minutes. The trail is hilly, so
		  about 30 minutes of the walk is moderate-intensity walking for her, and about
		  15 minutes is vigorous intensity (the 15 minutes of vigorous intensity counts
		  as 30 minutes of moderate-intensity walking). </li>
            <li>She adds at least an additional 30 minutes of walking each week in
		  different ways. For example, she walks her grandson to school, she walks to her
		  friends' homes, or she walks at the mall during shopping trips. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Manuel: An 85-Year-Old Man Living in an Assisted-Living Facility </h4>
          <p>
            Manuel, who has problems with falls, gets about 70 minutes (1 hour and
		10 minutes) of aerobic activity each week and has an individualized
		strength-training program. He cannot do 150 minutes of moderate intensity
		physical activity because of his chronic conditions, but he is being as
		physically active as his condition allows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To reduce the risk of falls, a physical therapist has prescribed an
		  individualized exercise program. This program includes 3 days a week (30
		  minutes each session) of strength- and balance-training exercises. Manueluses
		  ankle weights for lower body muscle strengthening exercises and does a series
		  of balance exercises. He does this program with the assistance of a residential
		  aide. </li>
            <li>Manuel's residence includes a garden with walking paths and
		  benches. He has gradually increased his physical activity to walking about 10
		  minutes each day. On some days he can walk more than on others, but he tries to
		  walk a little every day. The plan is for him to sustain this level of activity
		  for several weeks. </li>
            <li>After he builds strength and his balance improves, Manuel will
		  consider increasing his level of activity and joining an exercise class
		  specially designed to reduce the risk of falls in older people. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Anthony: A 65-Year-Old Man Living in a Retirement Community </h4>
          <p>
            Anthony has been active and fit all his life. He does 180 minutes of
		relatively vigorous-intensity activity each week, plus muscle-strengthening
		activities on 3 days.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Six days a week, Anthony gets up early and runs 3 miles, which takes
		  about 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>With help from staff at his community's fitness facility,
		  Anthony designed a weight-lifting program using weight machines. He does this
		  program on 3 days.</li>

          <p>
            Although physical activity has many health benefits, injuries and other
		adverse events do sometimes happen. The most common injuries affect the
		musculoskeletal system (the bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, and tendons).
		Other adverse events can also occur during activity, such as overheating and
		dehydration. On rare occasions, people have heart attacks during activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The good news is that scientific evidence strongly shows that physical
		activity is safe for almost everyone. Moreover, the health benefits of physical
		activity far outweigh the risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, people may hesitate to become physically active because of
		concern they’ll get hurt. For these people, there is even more good news:
		They can take steps that are proven to reduce their risk of injury and adverse
		events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guidelines in this chapter provide advice to help people do
		physical activity safely. Most advice applies to people of all ages. Specific
		guidance for particular age groups and people with certain conditions is also
		provided.
          </p>
          <h3>Explaining the Guidelines</h3>
          <h4>Physical Activity Is Safe for Almost Everyone</h4>
          <p>
            Most people are not likely to be injured when doing moderate-intensity
		activities in amounts that meet the <em>Physical Activity Guidelines</em>.
		However, injuries and other adverse events do sometimes happen. The most common
		problems are musculoskeletal injuries. Even so, studies show that only one such
		injury occurs for every 1,000 hours of walking for exercise, and fewer than
		four injuries occur for every 1,000 hours of running.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both physical fitness and total amount of physical activity affect risk
		of musculoskeletal injuries. People who are physically fit have a lower risk of
		injury than people who are not. People who do more activity generally have a
		higher risk of injury than people who do less activity. So what should people
		do if they want to be active and safe? The best strategies are to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be regularly physically active to increase physical fitness; and
            </li>
            <li>Follow the other guidance in this chapter (especially increasing
		  physical activity gradually over time) to minimize the injury risk from doing
		  medium to high amounts of activity. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Following these strategies may reduce <em>overall</em> injury risk.
		Active people are more likely to have an activity related injury than inactive
		people. But they appear less likely to have non-activity-related injuries, such
		as work-related injuries or injuries that occur around the home or from motor
		vehicle crashes.
          </p>
          <div class="BoxText">
            <h3>Key Guidelines for Safe Physical Activity</h3>
            <p>
              To do physical activity safely and reduce risk of injuries and other
		  adverse events, people should:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Understand the risks and yet be confident that physical activity
			 is safe for almost everyone. </li>
              <li>Choose to do types of physical activity that are appropriate for
			 their current fitness level and health goals, because some activities are safer
			 than others. </li>
              <li>Increase physical activity gradually over time whenever more
			 activity is necessary to meet guidelines or health goals. Inactive people
			 should “start low and go slow” by gradually increasing how often and
			 how long activities are done. </li>
              <li>Protect themselves by using appropriate gear and sports equipment,
			 looking for safe environments, following rules and policies, and making
			 sensible choices about when, where, and how to be active. </li>
              <li>Be under the care of a health-care provider if they have chronic
			 conditions or symptoms. People with chronic conditions and symptoms should
			 consult their health-care provider about the types and amounts of activity
			 appropriate for them. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h4>Choose Appropriate Types and Amounts of Activity</h4>
          <p>
            People can reduce their risk of injury by choosing appropriate types of
		activity. As the table shows, the safest activities are moderate intensity and
		low impact, and don’t involve purposeful collision or contact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking for exercise, gardening or yard work, bicycling or exercise
		cycling, dancing, swimming, and golf are activities with the lowest injury
		rates. In the amounts commonly done by adults, walking (a
		moderate–intensity and low-impact activity) has a third or less of the
		injury risk of running (a vigorous-intensity and higher impact activity).
          </p>
          <p>
            The risk of injury for a type of physical activity can also differ
		according to the purpose of the activity. For example, recreational bicycling
		or bicycling for transportation leads to fewer injuries than training for and
		competing in bicycle races.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who have had a past injury are at risk of injuring that body
		part again. The risk of injury can be reduced by performing appropriate amounts
		of activity and setting appropriate personal goals. Performing a variety of
		different physical activities may also reduce the risk of overuse injury.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              The risk of injury to bones, muscles, and joints is directly related
		  to the gap between a person’s usual level of activity and a new level of
		  activity.
            </p>
          </div>

            <em>Note:</em> The same activity done for different
		purposes and with different frequency, intensity, and duration leads to
		different injury rates. Competitive activities tend to have higher injury rates
		than non-competitive activities, likely due to different degrees of intensity
		of participation.
          </p>
          <h4>Increase Physical Activity Gradually Over Time</h4>
          <p>
            Scientific studies indicate that the risk of injury to bones, muscles,
		and joints is directly related to the gap between a person’s usual level
		of activity and a new level of activity. The size of this gap is called the
		amount of overload. Creating a small overload and waiting for the body to adapt
		and recover reduces the risk of injury. When amounts of physical activity need
		to be increased to meet the Guidelines or personal goals, physical activity
		should be increased gradually over time, no matter what the person’s
		current level of physical activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists have not established a standard for how to gradually
		increase physical activity over time. The following recommendations give
		general guidance for inactive people and those with low levels of physical
		activity on how to increase physical activity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use relative intensity (intensity of the activity relative to a
		  person’s fitness) to guide the level of effort for aerobic activity. </li>

            <li>Generally start with relatively moderate-intensity aerobic activity.
		  Avoid relatively vigorous-intensity activity, such as shoveling snow or
		  running. Adults with a low level of fitness may need to start with light
		  activity, or a mix of light- to moderate-intensity activity. </li>
            <li>First, increase the number of minutes per session (duration), and the
		  number of days per week (frequency) of moderate-intensity activity. Later, if
		  desired, increase the intensity. </li>
            <li>Pay attention to the relative size of the increase in physical
		  activity each week, as this is related to injury risk. For example, a 20-minute
		  increase each week is safer for a person who does 200 minutes a week of walking
		  (a 10 percent increase), than for a person who does 40 minutes a week (a 50
		  percent increase). </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The available scientific evidence suggests that adding a small and
		comfortable amount of light- to moderate–intensity activity, such as 5 to
		15 minutes of walking per session, 2 to 3 times a week, to one’s usual
		activities has a low risk of musculoskeletal injury and no known risk of severe
		cardiac events. Because this range is rather wide, people should consider three
		factors in individualizing their rate of increase: age, level of fitness, and
		prior experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Age</strong><br>
            The amount of time required to adapt to a new
		level of activity probably depends on age. Youth and young adults probably can
		safely increase activity by small amounts every week or 2. Older adults appear
		to require more time to adapt to a new level of activity, in the range of 2 to
		4 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Level of Fitness</strong><br>
            Less fit adults are at higher risk
		of injury when doing a given amount of activity, compared to fitter adults.
		Slower rates of increase over time may reduce injury risk. This guidance
		applies to overweight and obese adults, as they are commonly less physically
		fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Prior Experience</strong><br>
            People can use their experience to
		learn to increase physical activity over time in ways that minimize the risk of
		overuse injury. Generally, if an overuse injury occurred in the past with a
		certain rate of progression, a person should increase activity more slowly the
		next time.
          </p>
          <h4>Take Appropriate Precautions</h4>
          <p>
            Taking appropriate precautions means using the right gear and equipment,
		choosing safe environments in which to be active, following rules and policies,
		and making sensible choices about how, when, and where to be active.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use Protective Gear and Appropriate Equipment</strong><br>
            Using
		personal protective gear can reduce the frequency of injury. Personal
		protective gear is something worn by a person to protect a specific body part.
		Examples include helmets, eyewear and goggles, shin guards, elbow and knee
		pads, and mouth guards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using appropriate sports equipment can also reduce risk of injury.
		Sports equipment refers to sport or activity-specific tools, such as balls,
		bats, sticks, and shoes.

		  injury prevention strategies for common physical activities.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>For the most benefit, protective equipment and gear should be:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The right equipment for the activity; </li>
            <li>Appropriately fitted; </li>
            <li>Appropriately maintained; and </li>
            <li>Used consistently and correctly. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Be Active in Safe Environments</strong><br>
            People can reduce
		their injury risks by paying attention to the places they choose to be active.
		To help themselves stay safe, people can look for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical separation from motor vehicles, such as sidewalks, walking
		  paths, or bike lanes; </li>
            <li>Neighborhoods with traffic-calming measures that slow down traffic;
            </li>
            <li>Places to be active that are well-lighted, where other people are
		  present, and that are well-maintained (no litter, broken windows); </li>
            <li>Shock-absorbing surfaces on playgrounds; </li>
            <li>Well-maintained playing fields and courts without holes or
		  obstacles; </li>
            <li>Breakaway bases at baseball and softball fields; and </li>
            <li>Padded and anchored goals and goal posts at soccer and football
		  fields. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Follow Rules and Policies That Promote Safety</strong><br>
            Rules, policies, legislation, and laws are potentially the most effective and
		wide-reaching way to reduce activity-related injuries. To get the benefit,
		individuals should look for and follow these rules, policies, and laws. For
		example, policies that promote the use of bicycle helmets reduce the risk of
		head injury among cyclists. Rules against diving into shallow water at swimming
		pools prevent head and neck injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Make Sensible Choices About How, When, and Where To Be
		Active</strong><br>
            A person’s choices can obviously influence the risk of
		adverse events. By making sensible choices, injuries and adverse events can be
		prevented. Consider weather conditions, such as extremes of heat and cold. For
		example, during very hot and humid weather, people lessen the chances of
		dehydration and heat stress by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Exercising in the cool of early morning as opposed to mid-day heat;
            </li>
            <li>Switching to indoor activities (playing basketball in the gym rather
		  than on the playground); </li>
            <li>Changing the type of activity (swimming rather than playing soccer);
            </li>
            <li>Lowering the intensity of activity (walking rather than running); and
            </li>
            <li>Paying close attention to rest, shade, drinking enough fluids, and
		  other ways to minimize effects of heat. </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              Inactive people who gradually progress over time to relatively
		  moderate-intensity activity have no known risk of sudden cardiac events, and
		  very low risk of bone, muscle, or joint injuries.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Exposure to air pollution is associated with several adverse health
		outcomes, including asthma attacks and abnormal heart rhythms. People who can
		modify the location or time of exercise may wish to reduce these risks by
		exercising away from heavy traffic and industrial sites, especially during rush
		hour or times when pollution is known to be high. However, current evidence
		indicates that the benefits of being active, even in polluted air, outweigh the
		risk of being inactive.
          </p>
          <h4>Advice From Health-Care Providers</h4>
          <p>
            The protective value of a medical consultation for persons with or
		without chronic diseases who are interested in increasing their physical
		activity level is not established. People without diagnosed chronic conditions
		(such as diabetes, heart disease, or osteoarthritis) and who do not have
		symptoms (such as chest pain or pressure, dizziness, or joint pain) do not need
		to consult a health-care provider about physical activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inactive people who gradually progress over time to relatively
		moderate-intensity activity have no known risk of sudden cardiac events, and
		very low risk of bone, muscle, or joint injuries. A person who is habitually
		active with moderate-intensity activity can gradually increase to vigorous
		intensity without needing to consult a health-care provider. People who develop
		new symptoms when increasing their levels of activity should consult a
		health-care provider.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull">
            <h4>For More Information</h4>
            <p>
              See <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter4.aspx" name="rdb-footnote-link-24" class="rdb-footnoted">Chapter 4—Active Adults</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-24">24</a></sup> for guidance and examples of how to
		  gradually increase activity levels.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Health-care providers can provide useful personalized advice on how to
		reduce risk of injuries. For people who wish to seek the advice of a
		health-care provider, it is particularly appropriate to do so when
		contemplating vigorous-intensity activity, because the risks of this activity
		are higher than the risks of moderate-intensity activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The choice of appropriate types and amounts of physical activity can be
		affected by chronic conditions. People with symptoms or known chronic
		conditions should be under the regular care of a health-care provider. In
		consultation with their provider, they can develop a physical activity plan
		that is appropriate for them. People with chronic conditions typically find
		that moderate-intensity activity is safe and beneficial. However, they may need
		to take special precautions. For example, people with diabetes need to pay
		special attention to blood sugar control and proper footwear during activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women who are pregnant and those who’ve recently had a baby should
		be under the regular care of a health-care provider. Moderate-intensity
		physical activity is generally safe for women with uncomplicated pregnancies,
		but women should talk with their provider about how to adjust the amounts and
		types of activity while they are pregnant and right after the baby’s
		birth.
          </p>

          <p>During pregnancy, women should avoid: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Doing activities that involve lying on their back after the first
		  trimester of pregnancy; and </li>
            <li>Doing activities with high risk of falling or abdominal trauma,
		  including contact or collision sports, such as horseback riding, soccer,
		  basketball, and downhill skiing. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            Gradually Increasing Physical Activity Over Time: Real-Life
		Examples
          </h3>
          <p>
            Here are two examples that show how people at different ages, levels of
		fitness, and levels of experience can safely become more active over time.
          </p>

          <h4>Bill: A Man Who Has Been Inactive for Many Years</h4>
          <p>
            Bill wants to work his way up to the equivalent of 180 to 210 minutes (3
		hours to 3 hours and 30 minutes) of walking a week. On weekdays he has time for
		up to 45 minutes of walking, and he plans to do something physically active
		each weekend. He decides to start with walking because it is moderate intensity
		and has a low risk of injury.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first week, Bill starts at a low level. He walks 10 minutes a
		  day 3 days a week. Sometimes he divides the 10 minutes a day into two sessions.
		  He prefers to alternate rest days and active days. (Total = 30 minutes a week.)
            </li>
            <li>Between weeks 3 and 8, Bill increases duration by adding 5 minutes a
		  day and continues walking on 3 non-consecutive days each week. The weekly
		  increase is 15 minutes. (Week 3 total = 45 minutes. Week 8 total = 120 minutes
		  or 2 hours.) </li>
            <li>In week 9, Bill adds another day of moderate intensity activity on
		  the weekend, and starts doing a variety of activities, including biking,
		  hiking, and an aerobics class. Gradually increasing the minutes of activity, by
		  week 12 he is doing 60 minutes or more of moderate-intensity activity on the
		  weekend. Reaching his goal: Over 3 months, Bill has increased to a total of 180
		  moderate-intensity minutes a week. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Kim: An Active Woman</h4>
          <p>
            Kim currently does 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of
		moderate-intensity activity. She wants to work up to at least the equivalent of
		300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity activity a week. She also wants to
		shift some of that moderate intensity activity to vigorous-intensity activity.
		Her current 150 minutes a week includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thirty minutes of mowing the grass 1 day a week; </li>
            <li>Thirty minutes of brisk walking 4 days a week; and </li>
            <li>Fifteen minutes of muscle-strengthening exercises 2 days a week.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Increasing frequency and duration:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Over a month, Kim adds walking on another weekday, and she gradually
		  adds 15 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on each of the 5 walking days
		  each week. This provides an additional 105 minutes (1 hour and 45 minutes) of
		  moderate–intensity activity. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Increasing intensity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Over the next month, Kim decides to replace some walking with
		  jogging. Instead of walking 45 minutes, she walks for 30 minutes and jogs for
		  15 minutes on each weekday, providing the equivalent of 300 minutes a week of
		  moderate-intensity physical activity from her walking and jogging. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Reaching her goal</strong>: After these increases, Kim is doing
		a total of 180 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week (walking and
		mowing) and also doing 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) of
		vigorous–intensity jogging. One minute of vigorous-intensity activity is
		about the same as 2 minutes of moderate intensity activity, so she is now doing
		the equivalent of 330 moderate-intensity minutes (5 hours and 30 minutes) a
		week. She has more than met her goal.

            All Americans should be physically active to improve overall health and
		fitness and to prevent many adverse health outcomes. Most Americans should
		follow the Guidelines of the child and adolescent, adult, or older adult
		chapters, depending upon their age. However, some people have conditions that
		raise special issues about recommended types and amounts of physical activity.
		This chapter provides guidance on physical activity for healthy women who are
		pregnant and for people with disabilities. This chapter also affirms and
		illustrates how physical activity is generally appropriate for adults with
		chronic conditions by considering three groups of adults:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adults with osteoarthritis; </li>
            <li>Adults with type 2 diabetes; and </li>

            Physical Activity for Women During Pregnancy and the Postpartum
		Period
          </h3>
          <p>
            Physical activity during pregnancy benefits a woman’s overall
		health. For example, moderate-intensity physical activity by healthy women
		during pregnancy maintains or increases cardiorespiratory fitness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong scientific evidence shows that the risks of moderate-intensity
		activity done by healthy women during pregnancy are very low, and do not
		increase risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, or early pregnancy loss.
		Some evidence suggests that physical activity reduces the risk of pregnancy
		complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, and reduces the
		length of labor, but this evidence is not conclusive.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a normal postpartum period, regular physical activity continues
		to benefit a woman’s overall health. Studies show that moderate-intensity
		physical activity during the period following the birth of a child increases a
		woman’s cardiorespiratory fitness and improves her mood. Such activity
		does not appear to have adverse effects on breast milk volume, breast milk
		composition, or infant growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physical activity also helps women achieve and maintain a healthy
		weight during the postpartum period, and when combined with caloric
		restriction, helps promote weight loss.

		  Period
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Healthy women who are not already highly active or doing
			 vigorous-intensity activity should get at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30
			 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week during pregnancy and
			 the postpartum period. Preferably, this activity should be spread throughout
			 the week. </li>
            <li>Pregnant women who habitually engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic
			 activity or are highly active can continue physical activity during pregnancy
			 and the postpartum period, provided that they remain healthy and discuss with
			 their health-care provider how and when activity should be adjusted over time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Explaining the Guidelines</h4>
          <p>
            Women who are pregnant should be under the care of a health-care
		provider with whom they can discuss how to adjust amounts of physical activity
		during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Unless a woman has medical reasons
		to avoid physical activity during pregnancy, she can begin or continue
		moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity during her pregnancy and after the
		baby is born.
          </p>
          <p>
            When beginning physical activity during pregnancy, women should
		increase the amount gradually over time. The effects of vigorous-intensity
		aerobic activity during pregnancy have not been studied carefully, so there is
		no basis for recommending that women should begin vigorous-intensity activity
		during pregnancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women who habitually do vigorous-intensity activity or high amounts of
		activity or strength training should continue to be physically active during
		pregnancy and after giving birth. They generally do not need to drastically
		reduce their activity levels, provided that they remain healthy and discuss
		with their health-care provider how to adjust activity levels during this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            During pregnancy, women should avoid doing exercises involving lying on
		their back after the first trimester of pregnancy. They should also avoid doing
		activities that increase the risk of falling or abdominal trauma, including
		contact or collision sports, such as horseback riding, downhill skiing, soccer,
		and basketball.
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Activity for People With Disabilities</h3>
          <p>
            The benefits of physical activity for people with disabilities have
		been studied in diverse groups. These groups include stroke victims, people
		with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, muscular
		dystrophy, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, limb amputations, mental
		illness, intellectual disability, and dementia.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, the evidence shows that regular physical activity provides
		important health benefits for people with disabilities. The benefits include
		improved cardiovascular and muscle fitness, improved mental health, and better
		ability to do tasks of daily life. Sufficient evidence now exists to recommend
		that adults with disabilities should get regular physical activity. Physical
		activity in children and adolescents with disabilities is considered in

          <h3>Key Guidelines for Adults With Disabilities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Adults with disabilities, who are able to, should get at least 150
			 minutes per week (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes
			 (1 hour and 15 minutes) per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an
			 equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.
			 Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and
			 preferably, it should be spread throughout the week. </li>
            <li>Adults with disabilities, who are able to, should also do
			 muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or high intensity that involve all
			 major muscle groups on 2 or more days per week as these activities provide
			 additional health benefits. </li>
            <li>When adults with disabilities are not able to meet the above
			 Guidelines, they should engage in regular physical activity according to their
			 abilities and should avoid inactivity. </li>
            <li>Adults with disabilities should consult their health-care providers
			 about the amounts and types of physical activity that are appropriate for their
			 abilities. </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Explaining the Guidelines</h4>
          <p>
            In consultation with their health-care providers, people with
		disabilities should understand how their disabilities affect their ability to
		do physical activity. Some may be capable of doing medium to high amounts of
		physical activity, and they should essentially follow the Guidelines for
		adults.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people with disabilities are not able to follow the Guidelines for
		adults. These people should adapt their physical activity program to match
		their abilities, in consultation with their health-care providers. Studies show
		that physical activity can be done safely when the program is matched to an
		individual’s abilities.
          </p>

          <h4>Meeting the Guidelines</h4>
          <p>
            People with disabilities are encouraged to get advice from professionals
		with experience in physical activity and disability because matching activity
		to abilities can require modifying physical activity in many different ways.
		Some people with disabilities also need help with their exercise program. For
		example, some people may need supervision when performing muscle-strengthening
		activities, such as lifting weights.
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Activity for People With Chronic Medical Conditions</h3>
          <p>
            Adults with chronic conditions should engage in regular physical
		activity because it can help promote their quality of life and reduce the risk
		of developing new conditions. The type and amount of physical activity should
		be determined by a person’s abilities and the severity of the chronic
		condition. Three examples are provided below to illustrate the benefits of
		physical activity for persons with chronic conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many chronic conditions, physical activity provides therapeutic
		benefits and is part of recommended treatment for the condition. However, this
		chapter does not discuss therapeutic exercise or rehabilitation.
          </p>
          <p class="BoxText">
          </p>
          <h3>Key Messages for People With Chronic Medical Conditions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Adults with chronic conditions obtain important health benefits
			 from regular physical activity. </li>
            <li>When adults with chronic conditions do activity according to their
			 abilities, physical activity is safe. </li>
            <li>Adults with chronic conditions should be under the care of
			 health-care providers. People with chronic conditions and symptoms should
			 consult their health-care providers about the types and amounts of activity
			 appropriate for them. </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Example 1. Physical Activity for Adults With Osteoarthritis</h4>

          <p>
            Osteoarthritis is a common condition in older adults, and people can
		live many years with osteoarthritis. People with osteoarthritis are commonly
		concerned that physical activity can make their condition worse. Osteoarthritis
		can be painful and cause fatigue, making it hard to begin or maintain regular
		physical activity. Yet people with this condition should get regular physical
		activity to lower their risk of getting other chronic diseases, such as heart
		disease or type 2 diabetes, and to help maintain a healthy body weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong scientific evidence indicates that both aerobic activity and
		muscle-strengthening activity provide therapeutic benefits for persons with
		osteoarthritis. When done safely, physical activity does not make the disease
		or the pain worse. Studies show that adults with osteoarthritis can expect
		improvements in pain, physical function, quality of life, and mental health
		with regular physical activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with osteoarthritis should match the type and amount of physical
		activity to their abilities and the severity of their condition. Most people
		can usually do moderate-intensity activity for 150 minutes (2 hours and 30
		minutes) a week or more, and may choose to be active 3 to 5 days a week for 30
		to 60 minutes per episode. Some people with arthritis can safely do more than
		150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week and may be able to
		tolerate equivalent amounts of vigorous-intensity activity. Health-care
		providers typically counsel people with osteoarthritis to do activities that
		are low impact, not painful, and have low risk of joint injury. Swimming,
		walking, and strength-training are good examples of this type of activity.
          </p>

          <h4>Example 2. Physical Activity for Adults With Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
          <p>
            Physical activity in adults with type 2 diabetes shows how important it
		can be for people with a chronic disease to be active. Physical activity has
		important therapeutic effects in people with diabetes, but it is also routinely
		recommended to reduce risk of other diseases and help promote a healthy body
		weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, strong scientific evidence shows that physical activity
		protects against heart disease in people with diabetes. Moderate-intensity
		activity for about 150 minutes a week helps to substantially lower the risk of
		heart disease. A person who moves toward 300 minutes (5 hours) or more of
		moderate-intensity activity a week gets even greater benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adults with chronic conditions should work with their health-care
		providers to adapt physical activity so that it is appropriate for their
		condition. For example, people with diabetes must be careful to monitor their
		blood glucose and avoid injury to their feet.
          </p>
          <h4>Example 3. Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors</h4>
          <p>
            With modern treatments, many people with cancer can either be cured or
		survive for many years, living long enough to be at risk of other chronic
		conditions, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Some cancer
		survivors are at risk of recurrence of the original cancer. Some have
		experienced side effects of the cancer treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like other adults, cancer survivors should engage in regular physical
		activity for its preventive benefits. Physical activity in cancer survivors can
		reduce risk of new chronic diseases. Further, studies suggest physically active
		adults with breast or colon cancer are less like to die prematurely or have a
		recurrence of the cancer. Physical activity may also play a role in reducing
		adverse effects of cancer treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cancer survivors, like other adults with chronic conditions, should
		consult their health-care providers to match their physical activity plan to
		their abilities and health status.

          <p>
            The low level of physical activity among Americans is a major
		contributor to the burden of chronic disease. This burden is costly in terms of
		quality of life and economic resources needed to provide medical care. Like
		life in other modern societies around the world, life in the United States
		requires very little daily physical activity. The amount of physical activity
		we do is largely a matter of personal choice and the environmental conditions
		under which we live. So far, little progress has been made in meeting our
		national health objectives for physical activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on a careful review of the science, the <em>Physical Activity
		Guidelines</em> provides essential guidance to help Americans achieve the
		health benefits of regular physical activity. However, providing guidance by
		itself is not enough to produce change. Action is necessary. Regular physical
		activity needs to be made the easy choice for Americans.
          </p>
          <p>
            To accomplish this goal, public health research suggests the use of a
		“socio-ecologic” approach. This comprehensive approach involves
		action at all levels of society: individual, interpersonal, organizational,
		community, and public policy. Example actions include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Personal goal setting (individual level); </li>
            <li>Social support and encouragement to be active (interpersonal level);
            </li>
            <li>Promotion of physical activity as part of worksite health promotion
		  programs (organizational); </li>
            <li>Good access to parks and recreational facilities in neighborhoods
		  (community); and </li>
            <li>Promotion of policies that support families who want their children
		  to walk or bike to school (public policy). </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To give a sense of how to make regular physical activity the easy
		choice, the remainder of this chapter first considers steps individuals can
		take to adopt an active lifestyle. Then it considers steps society can take to
		support and facilitate active lifestyles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose is to illustrate achievable steps that will make a
		difference, not to address everything that needs to be done.
          </p>
          <h3>What Can Adults Do To Get Enough Physical Activity?</h3>
          <p>
            Adults can find advice on how to be active from many sources, including
		fitness professionals, health-care providers, books, and Web sites. Here are
		three commonly cited steps adults can take to help meet the Guidelines.
          </p>
          <h4>Personalize the Benefits of Regular Physical Activity</h4>
          <p>
            Adults need to identify benefits of personal value to them. For many
		people, the health benefits, which are the focus of the <em>Physical Activity
		Guidelines for Americans</em>, are compelling enough. For others, different
		reasons are key motivators to be active. For example, physical activity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provides opportunities to enjoy recreational activities, often in a
		  social setting; </li>
            <li>Improves personal appearance; </li>
            <li>Provides a chance to help a spouse lose weight; </li>
            <li>Improves the quality of sleep; </li>
            <li>Reduces feelings of low energy; and </li>
            <li>Gives older adults a greater opportunity to live independently in
		  the community. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Set Personal Goals for Physical Activity</h4>
          <p>
            The Guidelines alone don’t provide enough information for
		individuals to decide the types and amounts of activity that are appropriate
		for them. Individuals should set goals for activity that allow them to achieve
		benefits they value. Simple goals are fine. For example, a brisk walk in the
		neighborhood with friends for 45 minutes 3 days a week and walking to lunch
		twice a week may be just the right approach for someone who wants to increase
		both physical activity and social opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            In setting goals, people can consider doing a variety of activities and
		try both indoor and outdoor activities. In particular, public parks and
		recreation areas in the United States offer opportunities to experience nature
		and be physically active at the same time.
          </p>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              The best physical activity is the one that is enjoyable enough to do
		  regularly.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Develop Knowledge To Attain Goals</h4>
          <p>
            It is important to learn about the types and amount of activity needed
		to attain personal goals. For example, if weight loss is a goal, it’s
		useful to know that vigorous-intensity activity can be much more time-efficient
		in burning calories than moderate-intensity activity. If running is a goal,
		it’s important to learn how to reduce risk of running injuries by
		selecting an appropriate training program and proper shoes. If regular walking
		is a goal, learning about neighborhood walking trails can help a person attain
		the goal.
          </p>
          <div class="BoxText">
            <h3>Using a Pedometer To Track Walking</h3>
            <p>
              For adults who prefer walking as a form of aerobic activity,
		  pedometers or step counters are useful in tracking progress toward personal
		  goals. Popular advice, such as walking 10,000 steps a day, is not a Guideline
		  per se, but a way people may choose to meet the Guidelines. The key to using a
		  pedometer to meet the Guidelines is to first set a time goal (minutes of
		  walking a day) and then calculate how many steps are needed each day to reach
		  that goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Episodes of brisk walking that last at least 10 minutes count toward
		  meeting the Guidelines. However, just counting steps using a pedometer
		  doesn’t ensure that a person will achieve those 10-minute episodes. People
		  generally need to plan episodes of walking if they are to use a pedometer and
		  step goals appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a basis for setting step goals, it’s preferable that people
		  know how many steps they take per minute of a brisk walk. A person with a low
		  fitness level, who takes fewer steps per minute than a fit adult, will need
		  fewer steps to achieve the same amount of walking time.
            </p>
            <p>One way to set a step goal is the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To determine usual daily steps from baseline activity, a person
			 wears a pedometer to observe the number of steps taken on several ordinary days
			 with no episodes of walking for exercise. Suppose the average is about 5,000
			 steps a day. </li>
              <li>While wearing the pedometer, the person measures the number of
			 steps taken during 10 minutes of an exercise walk. Suppose this is 1,000 steps.
			 Then, for a goal of 40 minutes of walking for exercise, the total number of
			 steps would be 4,000 (1,000 × 4). </li>
              <li>To calculate a daily step goal, add the usual daily steps (5,000)
			 to the steps required for a 40-minute walk (4,000), to get the total steps per
			 day (5,000 + 4,000 = 9,000). </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Each week the person gradually increases the time walking for
		  exercise until the step goal is reached. Rate of progression should be
		  individualized. Some people who start out at 5,000 steps a day can add 500
		  steps per day each week. Others, who are less fit and starting out at a lower
		  number of steps, should add a smaller number of steps each week.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>
            How Can We Help Children and Adolescents Get Enough Physical
		Activity?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many children and adolescents are naturally physically active, and they
		need opportunities to be active and to learn skills. They benefit from
		encouragement from parents and other adults. Adults can promote age-appropriate
		activity in youth through these steps:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide time for both structured and unstructured physical activity
		  during school and outside of school. Children need time for active play.
		  Through recess, physical activity breaks, physical education classes,
		  after-school programs, and active time with family and friends, youth can learn
		  about physical activity and spend time doing it. </li>
            <li>Provide children and adolescents with positive feedback and good
		  role models. It has been said that if you do not practice what you teach, you
		  are teaching something else. Parents and teachers should model and encourage an
		  active lifestyle for children. Praise, rewards, and encouragement help children
		  to be active. Using physical activity as punishment does not help children to
		  be active. </li>
            <li>Help young people learn skills required to do physical activity
		  safely. As appropriate for their age, youth need to understand how to regulate
		  the intensity of activity, increase physical activity gradually over time, set
		  goals, use protective gear and proper equipment, follow rules, and avoid
		  injuries. </li>
            <li>Promote activities that set the basis for a lifetime of activity.
		  Children and adolescents should be exposed to a variety of activities,
		  including active recreation, team sports, and individual sports. In this way,
		  they can find activities they can do well and enjoy. Include exposure to
		  activities that adults commonly do, such as jogging, bicycling, hiking, and
		  swimming. Young people should experience non-competitive activities and
		  activities that do not require above-average athletic skills. </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              Communities can provide many opportunities for physical activity, such
		  as walking trails, bicycle lanes on roads, sidewalks, and sports
		  fields.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>What Can Communities and Government Do To Help People Be Active?</h3>
          <p>
            Actions by communities and government can influence whether regular
		physical activity is an easy choice. Communities can provide many opportunities
		for physical activity, such as walking trails, bicycle lanes on roads,
		sidewalks, and sports fields. Organizations in the community have a role to
		play as well. Schools, places of worship, worksites, and community centers can
		provide opportunities and encouragement for physical activity.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Use Evidence-Based Approaches and Tailor Them to the Needs of
		Individual Communities
          </h4>
          <p>
            To be effective, physical activity promotion efforts should use an
		“evidence-based” approach. The CDC’s <em>Guide to Community
		Preventive Services</em><a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/Chapter8.aspx#preventive"><sup>1</sup></a> has reviewed
		many community-level approaches to promote physical activity, including these
		five strongly recommended strategies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Community-wide campaigns that combine physical activity messaging
		  (distributed through television, newspapers, radio, and other media) with
		  activities such as physical activity counseling, community health fairs, and
		  the development of walking trails. </li>
            <li>Point-of-decision prompts to encourage stair use. These are signs
		  placed at points where people make the decision either to use the stairs or to
		  use an elevator or escalator. The signs encourage the active option of stair
		  use. </li>
            <li>Physical education classes to increase activity. Physical education
		  classes should use a curriculum that increases the amount of time students are
		  active during class. </li>
            <li>Approaches that increase the reach of individual-level
		  interventions. For example, evidence-based, individual-level interventions can
		  reach more people when they are delivered in group settings or over the
		  telephone. </li>
            <li>Interventions that increase social support for physical activity.
		  These interventions start or enhance social-support networks, and include
		  efforts such as organizing a buddy system (two or more people who set regular
		  times to do physical activity together), walking groups, and community dances.
            </li>
            <li>Programs to create or enhance access to places to be physically
		  active. This can include building walking trails and providing public access to
		  school gymnasiums, playgrounds, or community centers. This also includes
		  worksite activity programs that provide access to onsite or offsite fitness
		  rooms, walking breaks, or other opportunities to engage in physical activity.
		  Interventions to improve access should also include outreach that increases
		  awareness of the opportunity to be active. </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="Pull2">
            <p>
              Implementing community-level approaches to physical activity requires
		  collaboration across sectors.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Involve Many Sectors in Promoting Physical Activity</h4>
          <p>
            Interventions to improve access should also include outreach that
		increases awareness of the opportunity to be active.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Policies and programs that support street-scale design principles
		  and practices that promote physical activity. For example, these types of
		  policies and programs use crosswalks, sidewalks, traffic calming, and other
		  safety measures to make it easier and safer for people to choose active
		  transportation. </li>
            <li>Policies and programs that support community- scale design
		  principles and practices that promote physical activity. Community-scale design
		  includes zoning that facilitates bicycling and walking by allowing schools,
		  housing, and businesses to be built near one another.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The following list identifies relevant sectors and illustrates roles
		they play in promoting physical activity. The division of functions in the
		community into the following sectors does not use mutually exclusive
		categories. These sectors were chosen simply to illustrate how parts of the
		community have a role to play in promoting physical activity. Some communities
		may use different names and divisions of functions.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Parks and recreation.</strong> This sector plays a lead role
		  in providing access to places for active recreation, such as playgrounds,
		  hiking and biking trails, basketball courts, sports fields, and swimming pools.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Law enforcement.</strong> Concern about crime can deter
		  people from outdoors recreation. Law enforcement can promote a safe environment
		  that facilitates outdoor activity. </li>
            <li><strong>Urban planning. </strong>Urban planning. The Guide to
		  Community Preventive Services recommends both street-scale and community-scale
		  design principles to promote physical activity. Urban planners have a lead role
		  in implementing design principles to promote physical activity. </li>
            <li><strong>Transportation. </strong>The transportation sector has a
		  lead role in designing and implementing options that provide areas for safe
		  walking and bicycling. Mass transit systems also promote walking, as people
		  typically walk to and from transit stops. Programs that support safe walking
		  and bicycling to school help children be more physically active. </li>
            <li><strong>Education.</strong> The education sector takes a lead role
		  in providing physical education, after-school sports, and public access to
		  school facilities during after-school hours. </li>
            <li><strong>Architecture.</strong> Architects and builders can design
		  and construct buildings with active options, such as access to stairs. Campuses
		  should allow pedestrians pleasant and efficient methods of walking within and
		  between buildings. </li>
            <li><strong>Employers and private organizations. </strong>Employers and
		  private organizations. Employers can encourage workers to be physically active,
		  facilitate active transportation by supplying showers and secure bicycle
		  storage, and provide other incentives to be active. Private and faith-based
		  organizations can support community physical activity initiatives financially
		  or by providing space for programs. Health and fitness facilities and community
		  programs can provide access to exercise programs and equipment for a broad
		  range of people, including older adults and people with disabilities. Local
		  sports organizations can organize road races and events for the public. Senior
		  centers can provide exercise programs for older adults. </li>
            <li><strong>Health care. </strong>Health-care providers can assess,
		  counsel, and advise patients on physical activity and how to do it safely.
		  Health-care providers can model healthy behaviors by being physically active
		  themselves. </li>
            <li><strong>Public health.</strong> Public health departments can
		  monitor community progress in providing places and opportunities to be
		  physically active and can track changes in the proportion of the population
		  meeting the <em>Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</em>. They can also
		  take the lead in setting objectives and coordinating activities among sectors.
		  Public health departments and organizations can disseminate appropriate
		  messages and information to the public about physical activity. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <em>The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</em> gives guidance
		on the amount of physical activity that will provide health benefits for all
		Americans. Broad, comprehensive strategies are needed to help all Americans
		meet the Guidelines. Implementing a comprehensive strategy to increase physical
		activity requires an evidence-based approach that occurs at multiple levels and
		in all sectors. A comprehensive and coordinated strategy will help Americans
		take action to ensure that regular physical activity is the easy and accepted
		choice for everyone.
